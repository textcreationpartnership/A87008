            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <pb n="I" facs="tcp:119753:2"/>
            <head>A brief Account of one Suggestion OF THE <hi>ROMANIST.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">§. 1. IT is the Stateman's Maxime concerning a false Suggestion, that if it be believed but four and twenty hours, the value of it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable; which though it must be allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a grand abatement, when it is applyed to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and less considerable transactions, yet the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of Religion, in the maintenance of truth, are not so despiseable, as that he that hath appeared or embarked in them, can safely neglect the advantages which evil arts may yield, or furnish an adversary against him.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. Such in reason, and in Experience, beyond all others is the charge of <hi>falsifying,</hi> which if it be but suggested, and believed of any, and much more if a pregnant and visible proof of it be tendred, there needs no other blast, or smut, or vermine to lay wast the whole field, and deprive him of all harvest of his seed and labours.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. How this is my concernment at this time, the Reader will not suddenly divine, till I have entertain'd him with a short relation of that, which I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my self <hi>proclaim</hi> on the <hi>house top,</hi> then leave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to whisper it in <hi>corners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. I was lately advertised by a judicious and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend friend, that it was particularly urged against
<pb n="II" facs="tcp:119753:3"/> me, by a <hi>Romanist,</hi> that I had <hi>mistaken, or perverted M.</hi> Whites <hi>words, which I referr to in the Dispatcher Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatcht, Chap. III. Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 279. <hi>where I suppose him to answer</hi> (in his <hi>Apology for Trad. p.</hi> 56.) <hi>that the beatifical vision of the Saints before the day of Judgement was not yet held a matter of Faith, but onely a Theological conclusion; when</hi> (said he) <hi>the Apologist in that very place had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said, that this point is a matter of faith, grounded on Tradition, and not a Theological conclusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. That I should be guilty if but of such an osci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy or <hi>mistake,</hi> much more of such a vile <hi>perversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as this, I may be allowed to have been as unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self to believe, as I am obliged to take care that others should not causelessly apprehend it of me. Therefore without delay I turned first to mine own words (which as I then could not doubt, so now I acknowledge to be faithfully related) then to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>VVhites</hi> words, in the page of his <hi>Apology,</hi> whence I had cited them, and those I found exactly, and to a letter concordant to my transcript of them in <hi>Disp. Disp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. For thus I still read (if I will not at noon-day suspect mine own eyes) in that <hi>Apologist,</hi> p. 56. l. 12. <hi>[For, nothing is more clear, then that the validity of Baptism by hereticks was a Tradition, and decided by it: so the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical vision of the Saints before the day of Judgement, the Spirituality of Angels, are not yet held matters of Faith, but only Theological conclusions; as likewise the fouls being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created to the perfecting of the body.]</hi> What can be more manifest, then that in this period the <hi>Beatificall Vision of Saints before the day of judgement</hi> is by that <hi>Apologist</hi> set down, as one of the <hi>two</hi> things (to which after a <hi>third</hi> is subjoyn'd) of which it is affirmed in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="III" facs="tcp:119753:3"/> that they <hi>are not yet held matters of Faith, but onely Theological conclusions?</hi> which was all to a syllable, that I cited from him in that place, with this onely change, that speaking onely of <hi>one</hi> of these, <hi>the Beatifical vision</hi> &amp;c. I set it (as it was necessary) in the singular <hi>[is not yet held a matter of Faith, but onely a Theological conclusion.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. That I might be sure not to have mistaken my Author, I carefully consulted the <hi>Errata;</hi> but there was none noted, relating to that page: and indeed the whole composure of the period was such, that there must be a concurrence ot very many changes in the compass of very few lines (more I believe then the most negligent Compositor and Corrector have at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time conspired to be guilty of) to wrest this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from me, or change it into what this <hi>Romanist</hi> had affirmed it to be.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. Having dispatch't this account to my friend, from whom I received the former advertisement, I had no cause of doubt, but that this affair had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved its full period, the <hi>Romanist</hi> being obliged to yield to such full uncontrollable evidence, and every mans eyes, to whom the contrary suggestion could be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, being as well qualified as mine, to secure him from being misled by it. And on these grounds of safety I had no least thought of troubling the Reader with any account, or complaint, which I now see is become some part of my interest, and my duty.</p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. For I was soon assured by my friend, that the words which I had punctually transcribed from my copy of the Apology, were not to be found in that, which he had before him, but quite transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the contrary sence, even that for which the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist</hi> had vouch'd them; for thus he found them <hi>[For,
<pb n="IV" facs="tcp:119753:4"/> nothing is more clear, then that the validity of Baptism by hereticks was a Tradition, and decided by it: so the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical vision of the Saints before the day of judgement. The Spirituality of Angels is not yet held a matter of Faith, but onely a Theological conclusion.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. By this representation I was soon forced to confess, that the whole scene was changed, the first part of the words remaining the same, but the second (of the <hi>Beatifical vision of the Saints</hi>) which were my onely concernment, wholly transformed, that which before was joyned with the <hi>spirituality of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as not yet held matters of faith, but onely Theological conclusions,</hi> being now annext to the <hi>validity of Baptism by hereticks,</hi> and so affirmed to be a <hi>Tradition</hi> (and that is with him a matter of <hi>Faith) and decided by it.</hi> And then I had reason to acknowledge the candour of that <hi>Romanist,</hi> who proceeding on these appearances, had laid no heavier a censure on me, then that of <hi>either mistaking, or perverting M.</hi> Whites <hi>words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">§. 11. In this new posture of affairs, first it was presently discernible, that the very many changes, which I had foreseen, had been really made, to bring this about. And as all this was obvious, and credible to be done by a <hi>new Edition</hi> of the book, so it remained uncertain to me whether mine, or that other so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, were the true and authentick <hi>Edition:</hi> this therefore was my next care to examine.</p>
            <p n="12">§. 12. And herein again I met with an intricacy; for if the title-pages, and a concurrence of all obvious indications, might be believed, there was all this while but <hi>one edition,</hi> both copies carrying in their front, <hi>A Paris, chez Jean Billain Rue S. Jacques à l'en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign S. Augustin</hi> 1654. the same volume, print, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="V" facs="tcp:119753:4"/> of pages, beginning and end of every page, &amp;c. This soon suggested that which was the onely clue to extricate me then (and the reader now) out of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth. For sending to the Stationers for another co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the <hi>Apology,</hi> as from one I received a copy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agreeing with mine, so by the help of another I was furnisht with one exactly accordant to what my Monitor from the <hi>Romanist</hi> had represented to me, yet not discernibly differing from my own in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, save in this one passage; and looking more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, first the paper and ink wherein that leaf was printed (discernibly differing from all the rest of the book) was apt to inject some suspicion: but I soon saw that I had no need of this, or other obscurer intimation, it being grosly visible, that in this place a leaf had been cut out, &amp; a new one pasted in. And what <hi>Gordian</hi> knot might not have been untied by the like instrument?</p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. <hi>VVhen</hi> this change was thought fit to be made, I did, and still want augury to divine; onely this is apparent, that it was a work which second thoughts suggested, after the Book was published, else my copy which came regularly to me from the <hi>VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester-stationer,</hi> (in the year, if my memory fail me not, 1655.) and another now sent me from another Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner (which assures me there be many more) must have had their parts in the change.</p>
            <p n="14">§. 14. Having given the Reader a brief and single view of this matter, I abstain from any farther obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or reflexion on it, then what a
<q>Quo teneam vul us mutantem —?</q> will amount to. But that is also unnecessary, my whole design being compleated in this, that it is now manifest to the most impersuasible of their disciples,
<pb n="VI" facs="tcp:119753:5"/> that dare read what is written against their Masters (which I perceive few are permitted to do) that I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>mistook,</hi> nor <hi>perverted</hi> the <hi>Apologists</hi> sence or words, those, I mean, which I read in his book, from w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> alone I could be imagined to receive cognizance of them, not being able to forecast, that what I had thus really transcribed from him, would be so soon snatcht from me again, or that what was to me so visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, should vanish, and become invisible to other men.</p>
            <p n="15">§. 15. This indeed is an unexpected proof of what <hi>S. VV.</hi> had told me, concerning the <hi>VVits</hi> (enormous) power to transform <hi>Testimonies;</hi> which yet shal not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me from dealing in that ware, (being firmly resolved never to make use of my <hi>duller</hi> faculties, to work such <hi>Metamorphoses</hi>) nor yet from diverting sometimes into such pleasant fields, adorned with so great varieties, as that <hi>Apologist</hi> frequently affords the world, hoping, that I shall not again meet with such misadventures as these, or any greater interruptions in reading him, then what a competent attention, and a table of <hi>Errata</hi> shall enable me to overcome.</p>
            <p n="16">§. 16. This account I conceived would more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donably, because more moderately, divert the Reader at this time, then if I should stay till it were solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and articulately call'd for, and moreover deliver <hi>S. VV.</hi> from some temptation, himself to think, or to perswade others, that he had sprang some <hi>reall</hi> game to invite his chases, some guilt to support his <hi>contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> and perhaps prevail with some of their most cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous followers, to think it equitable to subject the suggestions they meet with to some other waies of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination and triall, then the bare authority or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the suggesters.</p>

W. <hi>into despair of his salvation, by denouncing and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him such horrid judgements for writing against the Saints.]</hi> To this I reply, 1. That it is indeed a <hi>sad case,</hi> that Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiations against a sin, so <hi>charitably,</hi> and <hi>affectionately</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by an <hi>Apostle</hi> as a speciall part of his <hi>Apostolicall</hi> office, to call all to self-examination, but the guilty to repentance, should be entertain'd with so little of earnest, or of that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind, which is due to any <hi>Apostolical</hi> denuntiation. 2.

W. <hi>had no more charity, than not to be afraid of driving him into despair of his salvation,</hi> he would think it a <hi>Christian</hi> reply, and either an argument of his innocencie, or a symptome of his relenting? 3. I hence learn somewhat of his <hi>dialect,</hi> 1. His notion of <hi>preaching,</hi> which he so oft useth as a style of <hi>scorn.</hi> 2. That other of <hi>Saints,</hi> which with him is wont to sound the same way. <hi>Preaching</hi> is here joyned with <hi>denouncing</hi> such <hi>horrid judgements,</hi> as were cited out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and can signifie no other than what St. <hi>Paul</hi> was guilty of, and I no otherwise, than as I transcribed St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words. And let him then judge, if 'twere truely <hi>his art,</hi> as elsewhere he pretends, which suggested this <hi>ironie,</hi> this part of his dialect to him. Next <hi>[the Saints]</hi> can signifie no more or other than Dr. <hi>H.</hi> for against him only it was that <hi>S. W.</hi> was charged to have written that, which he here affirms <hi>written
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119753:7"/> against the Saints:</hi> and then he that most seriously thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self ten thousand times <hi>lesse than the least of all Saints</hi> (and never assumed more, if so much as <hi>this</hi>) that knowes it hath been the general practice of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Scismaticks,</hi> to call themselves by titles of this kind, the <hi>pure,</hi> the <hi>perfect,</hi> the <hi>spiritual,</hi> the <hi>holy,</hi> the <hi>Saints,</hi> the <hi>godly,</hi> (and the very worst of men, the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,</hi> meant the same, when they assumed that title) must yet be as solemnly scoff't at under that style, as if he had indeed assumed it. 'Tis true I had mentioned <hi>saints</hi> in that Paragraph, to which he thus replies, and so also the <hi>true prophets of God,</hi> but the <hi>former</hi> in the expresse Scripture notion, for those that <hi>reign in heaven,</hi> and shall <hi>judge the world;</hi> and the <hi>second</hi> for those very <hi>Prophets</hi> whom the <hi>Jewes</hi> defamed and persecured; far from imagining, and as far from appearing, to include my self in either number; and if he meant to perswade any incau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Reader, that I did, then this was very injurious to us both, and an early instance of the <hi>undue</hi> and undeserved manner of his replies to my <hi>defense,</hi> which yet he averts in this period, and pretends no farther to vindicate <hi>his</hi> practises from the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> sentence, than he can <hi>justly</hi> avert it. I demand therefore, did I in the Paragraph he now replies to, (or any where else) assume to my self or party, the title of <hi>Saints?</hi> If he saith I did, I leave him to his own eyes and conscience to refute him; If I did not, then this part of my <hi>defense deserved</hi> not this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Reply</hi> which he hath given it; and having nothing to pretend for it but my <hi>desert,</hi> he hath already lost his <hi>only</hi> plea, as soon as he hath produced it.</p>

That my confession of the <hi>Romish factor,</hi> concerned only the <hi>style of drollery and Picquant sauce,</hi> by him made use of, and is no farther to be extended, then that the publisher gave a <hi>civiller title</hi> to his <hi>contumelies,</hi> than the Author himself. 2. That the <hi>list</hi> which the <hi>publisher</hi> set in the front of the book, was exactly conformable to what the <hi>Author</hi> had dispe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119753:8"/> body of it, and can no more lessen by dividing and taking part of his blame, than the divulger or proclaimer of a libell exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates the crime of him that pen'd it, and delivered it to be publisht. Nay 3. the <hi>bill of fare</hi> is so imperfect an <hi>Index</hi> of the contumelies of the book, that I have reason to think it set as a <hi>blind</hi> rather to <hi>conceal</hi> the greater variety of them, which was sure to be found in the Book, than a <hi>map</hi> only to <hi>point</hi> at them. 4. That as I, whose <hi>only</hi> businesse it was to consider the <hi>contumelies,</hi> can be no more presumed to <hi>know,</hi> or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to reflect on the <hi>person</hi> of <hi>S. W.</hi> than of the <hi>Romish factor,</hi> the Master of the <hi>Feast,</hi> than the collector of the <hi>bill of fare:</hi> so nothing that I have said in this matter is concerned in that <hi>inquiry.</hi> I have indeed oft heard the <hi>names,</hi> by which both of them are known, but as I am no whit satisfied for the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi> of their <hi>contumelies,</hi> by my having those <hi>imperfect</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of them, or by their having shared it betwixt them, (the heap, or load of soil smells never the more temperately, that there were more hands joyned to the collecting of it) so the <hi>Apostles</hi> sentences against that sin were produced by me for the use of <hi>all</hi> that had any part of that <hi>guilt</hi> on them, and meant not to raise a <hi>suspicion</hi> of guilt on any, that had it not. And yet 5. if <hi>S.</hi> and <hi>W.</hi> be characters that any one person means, or is willing to be known by, whoever it is that hath the <hi>comfort</hi> of being, or <hi>vanity</hi> of assuming to be the Author of these Answers, he is certainly responsible for all that appears from the Presse under his Signatures, as a Merchant is for the transactions of his Factor. <hi>Lastly,</hi> I have now no motive to incline me to affixe the collecting of the <hi>Index of Schisme di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatcht</hi> to any other hand, than what compiled the <hi>book,</hi> and that is much <hi>more contumelious,</hi> and injurious, than the former <hi>bill of fare,</hi> and so here be grounds enow to supersede and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of all benefit of that <hi>confession</hi> of mine, with which he begins his <hi>defense.</hi>

But, saith he, Dr. <hi>H. thinks he hath got a notable advantage against me from my own confession, that my blowes were rude and my adversary civil, whereas I used both those phrases as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Readers, as is most palpable.]</hi> I reply, 1. How he used them, must be judged by his own words, to which I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119753:8"/> referred in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Reader. Before,</hi> saith he, <hi>you can have past three Chapters, I know you will be objecting, that the blowes I give are too rude for so civil an adversary.]</hi> From hence all that I assumed was, that <hi>the Author who was fittest to name his own births, hath allowed them the plainer title of rude blowes.</hi> And what can be more <hi>palpable,</hi> than that he hath done so? 2. 'Tis as <hi>palpable</hi> that when this was written to the <hi>Reader,</hi> to <hi>meet him,</hi> as he saith, in <hi>the very entry,</hi> the Reader, of whom he speaks, could not as yet have made this objection, or be with truth by him pretended to make it, any otherwise then as <hi>S.W</hi>'s <hi>conscience</hi> assured him, there was place for this objection; These words <hi>[I know you will be objecting]</hi> being spoken by the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armer,</hi> can import no lesse to my understanding, than that this was a reflex't act of his <hi>own conscience,</hi> that there were in the <hi>three first Chapters</hi> competent motives to suggest to the <hi>Reader</hi> this <hi>objection,</hi> and I am not subtile enough to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this signification of this <hi>reflex't</hi> act of <hi>conscience,</hi> and his <hi>own confession,</hi> which yet he here vehemently averts, with what <hi>palpablenesse</hi> or <hi>evidence</hi> of truth, let him now judge. 3. If the Reader indefinitely taken, <hi>i. e. (in materia necessariâ,</hi> which alone is the matter of <hi>knowledge,</hi> here mention'd) <hi>every Reader</hi> be by <hi>S. W. yielded</hi> to <hi>object</hi> this, then is this as <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>large</hi> a <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> as may be, of the truth of the thing questioned, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>S. W's blowes</hi> were not only <hi>rude,</hi> but <hi>too rude,</hi> which was all that I designed to conclude from this <hi>medium.</hi> Other col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections I might have made from his mentioning the <hi>three first Chapters,</hi> and no more, and his mentioning them in an undue style, when that book of his is not divided into <hi>Chapters,</hi> but into <hi>three parts:</hi> and 13 <hi>Sections</hi> in the <hi>first part:</hi> But I desired not then, nor am yet fond of making <hi>impertinent</hi> discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But he hath more to say to this head. <hi>Had I,</hi> saith he, <hi>used them, the rudenesse of blowes argues not that they were not just, since none doubts but malefactors are very rudely, yet most justly whipt, and the courteous Epithet of civl denyed not, but the oyle in his tongue was accompanyed with venome in his heart, and so made it more necessary to discover that, whose only advantage it was to lurk undiscoverable.</hi> I reply, 1. That I assumed no more from his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119753:9"/> confession, than that <hi>the blowes were rude, and the adversary civil,</hi> and if that be granted, I have no more to demand, nor he to <hi>quarrel</hi> in this matter. For 2. if <hi>rudenesse</hi> should not conclude <hi>injustice,</hi> much lesse will it conclude the <hi>contrary;</hi> there will need other <hi>mediums</hi> to prove the <hi>blowes just,</hi> than <hi>[that they are rude, or that malefactors are punished justly]</hi> And till those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums are produced and proved effectual to the end, the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them <hi>just,</hi> is the <hi>begging the question,</hi> and so of no force to his present defense, and will be proved but a new <hi>contumelie,</hi> as oft as I shall in the process of this answer shew, that there is as much <hi>injustice,</hi> as <hi>rudenesse in his blowes.</hi> 3. I shall appeal to custom of speech, the best Dictionary, whether when a <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor</hi> is <hi>whipt</hi> by the <hi>Lictor,</hi> or <hi>beheaded</hi> by the <hi>Executioner,</hi> without any addition of his own spleen to the Judges sentence, he shall be said to have <hi>dealt rudely,</hi> or <hi>contumeliously</hi> with the <hi>malefactor?</hi> or whether strength of argument in a disputant would by the Reader indefinitely be <hi>certain</hi> (and so, as to be the object of <hi>S.W</hi>'s <hi>knowledge</hi>) to be styled <hi>rudenesse?</hi> If so, he hath not <hi>lost</hi> by this instance, though withall he hath not <hi>gained</hi> by it; but if not, let him then judge what cause it is, that is capable of no better defenses. But then 4. I must set a remark on that piece of <hi>Logick</hi> that follows, <hi>[The courteous Epithet of Civil denyed not, but the oyle in the tongue was accompanyed with venome in his heart, and so made it more necessary to discover that—]</hi> The force of this consequence and propriety to its being a part of <hi>S. W</hi>'s <hi>defense,</hi> depends on these two things, 1. That <hi>under the outside of Civility, poyson was discovered to lurk.</hi> 2. That the <hi>rude blowes</hi> were some way <hi>necessary</hi> to the making this <hi>discovery;</hi> now 1. I demand, is that presently <hi>eo ipso</hi> inferred and <hi>proved,</hi> that <hi>every thing</hi> else doth <hi>not deny:</hi> The word <hi>[civill]</hi> is not pretended by me to have any force of <hi>probation,</hi> either as to the <hi>truth,</hi> or the <hi>wholesomenesse</hi> of what is propounded, but neither is it any symptome of falsehood or <hi>poyson,</hi> any more than the contrary <hi>rudenesse</hi> is of the contrary. By what means then is the discovery made, which is here supposed? The only <hi>medium</hi> here mention'd, is, That <hi>[The courteous Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet of Civil denyed it not.]</hi> But 1. it doth as much <hi>deny</hi> it, as <hi>words</hi> signifie <hi>things,</hi> or <hi>lips</hi> are interpreters of the <hi>heart,</hi> (for he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119753:9"/> that treats a man <hi>civilly,</hi> doth at least tell him, that he means him no <hi>hurt</hi>) and all humane affirmations and negations are thus transacted; though it is true, there is frequently deceit in them, when <hi>false</hi> hearts have the managing of them. 2. Therefore, if it doth not <hi>deny</hi> it, what is gained toward the <hi>discovery?</hi> There be ten thousand propositions (which are more than single words) in the <hi>Bible,</hi> none of which <hi>deny Lucifer</hi> to be the <hi>Messias;</hi> will this yield him any assistance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the acquiring of that dignity? To suppose then this <hi>lurking poyson</hi> without any other ground of inferring it, than that the <hi>Epithet of Civil denyed it not,</hi> is one essay of his discursive faculty that I was here to consider. And another is, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence that this hath on the <hi>rude blowes,</hi> or <hi>propriety</hi> to be an ingredient in the plea for them.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119753:10"/> not unreasonable in him to allow me the comfort once to sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit the <hi>Readers smile,</hi> when he hath the profuser joyes of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining him with a <hi>loud laughter,</hi> whole dayes together. Hath he the <hi>Leviathans</hi> priviledge of <hi>sporting</hi> alone in the <hi>waters,</hi> the inclosure of game, the patent of having all <hi>mirth</hi> wrapt up in <hi>his</hi> papers? Was it an undecency in me thus to <hi>refresh</hi> the Reader, once in a long wearisome journey, or was it not? If not, why is it mention'd by him, whose every word is presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be <hi>immediate,</hi> and so to have <hi>demonstrative</hi> force in it? If it was, why doth <hi>S. W.</hi> so over-imitate what he thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns? But 2. for the truth of what he charges on me, either that I <hi>reiterate</hi> it at all, or to that end of making the <hi>Reader smile,</hi> I have been at so much leisure, as to read over all I have said in that matter, and find his suggestion very distant from all appearance of truth, in both particulars. I name the phrase but <hi>twice,</hi> and that at no lesse distance than is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the first part of the 2<seg rend="sup">d,</seg> and the last of the 6<seg rend="sup">th</seg> page, once in reciting his words, the other time in refuting them, and if this had been called <hi>iterating,</hi> I had not resisted, but I am sure it is not <hi>reiterating.</hi> And when the Reader turns to the places, he will find, that as the <hi>iteration</hi> had no propriety to make any man <hi>smile,</hi> so each passage was delivered with as much of earnest, and as little of <hi>irony,</hi> as any other line of the Book, and then again he will judge, what credit is to be given to <hi>S. W</hi>'s relations.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. To the second, 1. What appearance or semblance is there, that I <hi>took the phrase in the downright sense?</hi> or how was it possible I should so take it?

Nay, are not these my words? <hi>Rude blowes and twitchings by the beard, declamation and satyre, are none of these justifiable and lawfull means?</hi> What could more wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse my understanding his <hi>allegory,</hi> than my <hi>interpreting</hi> it? 2. If in the down-right sense his <hi>twitching</hi> be acknowledged somewhat <hi>too rude,</hi> can it avoid being so in the <hi>allegory?</hi> Are his <hi>tropes</hi> so inartificial, his expressions so feeble, and imperfect, as to signifie lesse than they sound? Is not that which was <hi>alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:119753:11"/> meant by that style, as really <hi>rude</hi> in another kinde, as the <hi>down-right twitching</hi> would be? If it be, then what a defense is this? [<hi>if understood in the down-right sense it was somewhat too rude, but being spoken in a sense</hi> that signified as much as the <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> it did not yet signifie <hi>so much rudenesse.</hi>] If it be not, we have then lost our <hi>Rhetoricks</hi> too, as well as our <hi>Logick</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 3. Then, hath he mended the matter by adding, he <hi>spake it in order to my wearing a Vizard?</hi> Is a contumely allayd by being <hi>doubled,</hi> shall falsities imitate negations, and two <hi>Pasquils</hi> become a <hi>Panegyrick?</hi> I must not blame <hi>S.

                  <p n="12">12. Yet all these are but preparatives to his <hi>third,</hi> and last medicament, wherewith he hath throughly purged himself. Let <hi>me confesse that he found me in a vizard, and he is content to be thought so uncivil</hi>— It seems, I must <hi>justifie</hi> his calumnies, and then he will bear the blame of them. My <hi>avowed</hi> guilts must evince me <hi>injured,</hi> and the <hi>truth</hi> of his accusations demonstrate them <hi>unreasonable:</hi> Mean while, till I <hi>deserve</hi> rudenesse, he that heaps it on me, is <hi>innocent.</hi> Thus deer must a man pay for <hi>S.

                  <p n="13">13. His next Paragraph, <hi>p.</hi> 4. and 5. is spent in inquiring <hi>with what Logick I huddle together those testimonies out of Scripture for</hi> S. W<hi>'s pasport to hell, unlesse I could evidence that they were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly appliable to him.</hi>] I reply, 1. That I should think it <hi>strange Logick</hi> indeed, to inferre from my producing the sentences of <hi>Scripture</hi> against railing, that I gave any man that is most guilty of it, a <hi>pasport to hell.</hi> I had thought denuntiations of Scripture had been designed to <hi>bring sinners to repentance,</hi> to rescue <hi>from hell,</hi> not to conveigh any man thither. I had thought, that this was one of our Saviours means to demonstrate himself a <hi>Saviour,</hi> by warning of the danger of sin, to redeem men from it, and so to <hi>blesse by turning,</hi> and by terrors the means of <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And I am sure no man can evacuate this <hi>Logick,</hi> but he that resolves he will not <hi>amend</hi> what is under those denuntiations, and till <hi>S.

But then 2. what defect could there be in my <hi>evidence,</hi> that those <hi>testimonies</hi> were <hi>particularly appliable</hi> to him? When the crime to which those testimonies belong'd, was so visible almost in every page (of the first part especially) of his Book, that himself profess'd to <hi>know</hi> that the <hi>Reader</hi> would think him guilty of it, and as plainly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges it, as <hi>twitchings by the beard</hi> shall <hi>allegorically</hi> be able to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>contumelies,</hi> and when I had first laid that for the ground of my procedure, before I advanced to produce those <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi>

                  <p n="14">14. But it seems another kind of <hi>particular application</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of me, that of shewing that <hi>contumelious words are so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly damnable, that no circumstance can render them inculpable, or at least venial, if not necessary or convenient.</hi>] But I reply, that if this strict manner of <hi>application</hi> be with any reason required of me, to be super-added to the producing of so plain, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, comprehensive <hi>testimonies,</hi> that very reason is alone suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to evacuate the main of his <hi>Apology,</hi> that either in his <hi>Epistle to the indifferent Reader,</hi> or in this place, he hath offer'd for himself.

                  <p n="29">29. This could not be attempted without a conspiration of many Artifices; let us view them orderly: 1. My words are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119753:17"/> mutilated, with an &amp;c. which was probably meant to do some small service, for if he had read out, my period had thus evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced its own sense, <hi>He hath solemnly annext a list of the contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies,</hi> 33 <hi>pickt out by specialty out of the farre greater number.</hi> Here then I supposed and affirmed, that there were a <hi>far greater number</hi> than 33, and nothing hinders, but several of those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, might be far greater then any that were set down in the <hi>publishers list,</hi> and I never informed him or the Reader, that there were not. For 2. that I say <hi>these were the special or chief,</hi> is absolutely <hi>imposed</hi> upon the Reader, who at the first cast of his eye on my words, will discern 'tis <hi>S.

That by <hi>picking out these by specialty,</hi> I should mean, though not <hi>say,</hi> that these were the <hi>special,</hi> as that word signifies the <hi>chief</hi> of them, is a great violence to the words, and as great to my sense, of which those were the Interpreters. To <hi>pick out by specialty,</hi> I conceived to signifie, <hi>choosing</hi> out so many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and setting them down <hi>distinctly</hi> and <hi>severally,</hi> as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon speech it hath been familiar to my ears; And what if <hi>special</hi> oft signifies <hi>chief,</hi> that use of the adjective hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the (as common) use of <hi>specialty.</hi> Had I meant as he would have me, I had certainly said, <hi>pickt out as the prime, or special, or principal,</hi> but because I meant not so, these were not my words, but others which to any that understands plain <hi>English,</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently exprest this my <hi>other</hi> meaning. 4. Of these 33. he will <hi>instance only in one,</hi> and his only pretended reason of doing so, is, that <hi>he may not trouble the Reader.</hi> But he hath not been so tender of the <hi>Readers trouble,</hi> when he hoped for advantage thereby, and I can tell him another more usefull, and so not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable <hi>reason</hi> of his <hi>reservednesse;</hi> When that one is produced, he knowes it is but <hi>one,</hi> and that there be 32. behind in that list, and many more not entred into that catalogue, every of which is as contumelious as this one, and all together, by accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much above 32 times as great, as this one by it self is: And yet this <hi>one</hi> must be the <hi>only</hi> measure, by which the whole matter must be judged, as if he that had stollen many more than 33 <hi>prizes,</hi> or committed as many acts of <hi>drunkennesse</hi> or <hi>forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> should make a slight confession of <hi>one</hi> of them, and then were presently free from the guilt of <hi>that,</hi> and of all the <hi>rest</hi> also.

To the third, 1. That producing St. <hi>Pauls</hi> plain words against a sin, is far from <hi>railing</hi> at all, farther yet from <hi>exceeding him</hi> in that language. 2. That for the parallel of his <hi>dame,</hi> which is his (only <hi>rhetorical</hi>) argument to prove it, it is of no force, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause though I should allow the parallel to hold in one part, between St. <hi>Pauls words</hi> produced on one side, and <hi>Scripture phrase</hi> on the other (which yet till I know what that <hi>phrase</hi> was which the <hi>Dame</hi> used, but <hi>S. W.</hi> hath not recited from her <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> I am not obliged to doe) yet still the question remains, what parallel will be found for the <hi>cudgell,</hi> wherein surely all the weight of the <hi>simile,</hi> and the <hi>Dames severity</hi> consisted, and not in the <hi>Scripture phrase;</hi> To the last, that when it appears that I have accused him of <hi>falsifying,</hi> if I do not render a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable account of it, I will, as he requires, confesse, and make satisfaction for the <hi>calumny;</hi> but as yet he hath not directed me to the place, and my memory suggests it not, and therefore I discern not my self to be under any further present obligation. Only I shall demand, who it is, whom he can think it possible I should have accused of <hi>falsifying?</hi> Is <hi>S. W.</hi> the name of any man, or be there any Lawes of <hi>Brachygraphie,</hi> by which those letters are authorized to signifie any more than <hi>N. N.</hi> are wont to doe? Is any person living vulgarly known, or called by that name? If not, 'tis not only not <hi>true,</hi> but not <hi>possible,</hi> that in answering <hi>N. N.</hi> or <hi>S.

The one ground of that, <hi>universal Tradition,</hi> together with the notion in which he understands that phrase. 3. The duty consequent to this, of <hi>using the means and wayes, which wit and art can invent to confute, and discredit his adversaries harmfull sophistry, and disparage his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as far as truth can justifie his words.</hi> 4, The deemed <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their faith,</hi> who rely on any other but this one deemed <hi>certain Rule,</hi> together with the obligation incumbent on them, and arising from the <hi>deemed uncertainty of their faith, to write without any great zeal, heat, or earnestnesse, which in them,</hi> saith he, <hi>can arise from nothing but passion and interest.</hi> 5. What he hath thought fit to adde concerning my person, abstracted from the cause.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the <hi>first</hi> of these he is carefull himself to propose it under that cautious style of <hi>deemed certainty,</hi> foreseeing as he saith, that else the <hi>Doctor would mistake him (as his custom is) to begge the question, by supposing their faith certain.]</hi> But to this I make my demands, 1. Whether it be indeed, or possibly could be a <hi>mistake</hi> in the Doctor, contending with <hi>S. W.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth of his faith, to affirm that his <hi>supposing his faith certain, is the begging of the question?</hi> Might he not as well have said that the Doctor was apt (as his custome is) to <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake</hi> in affirming twice two to be four? For is not the <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that certain,</hi> of which the <hi>question</hi> is whether it be <hi>true,</hi> as evidently the <hi>begging the question,</hi> as it is evident, that what is <hi>certain,</hi> is <hi>true,</hi> and more than <hi>true, true</hi> with the advantage of <hi>certainty?</hi> And is any <hi>common notion,</hi> or any <hi>axiome,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion in the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> more evident than that? What semblance of truth then is there in suggesting, or intimating this to be a mistake in the Doctor? or how can <hi>his art,</hi> as he saith, <hi>bear him out</hi> in thus suggesting. 2. Doth <hi>S. W.</hi> mean to keep himself precisely from the guilt of this fallacy for the future? Is he so sensible of the unskilfulness of it, as seriously to disclaim having any more to do with it? Nay, hath he indeed by this early caution shut it out of <hi>this Section?</hi> or is it sufficient to fore-see crimes and then presently to rush into
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119753:20"/> them? 'tis the <hi>begging of the question</hi> for him to <hi>suppose his faith certain,</hi> and is it not so also to suppose <hi>contumelies</hi> a lawfull means to defend a <hi>deemed truth,</hi> at the very time when we are in the debate, whether <hi>such</hi> means are not utterly <hi>unlawfull?</hi> This certainly he supposes at this time, for else 'tis not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable how the <hi>deemed certainty of his faith</hi> should found a <hi>necessity of his contumelies.</hi> That which is in it self <hi>lawfull,</hi> may by <hi>circumstances</hi> become <hi>necessary</hi> to some man, and so to <hi>S. W.</hi> but if it be in it self unlawfull, neither the <hi>deemed</hi> nor <hi>real cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of their <hi>faith</hi> can make it <hi>lawfull,</hi> much lesse <hi>necessary.</hi> This then of its <hi>lawfulnesse,</hi> which cannot be founded in his <hi>deemed certainty,</hi> nor is endeavour'd here to be inferr'd either by that, or by any other <hi>medium,</hi> and yet is necessary to be supposed in that discourse, where the <hi>necessite</hi> is inferr'd from some <hi>circumstances,</hi> is no other than the <hi>begging</hi> of the <hi>question,</hi> for no doubt that is said to be <hi>begg'd,</hi> which is <hi>supposed,</hi> without all attempt of proof. And so visibly here is the <hi>lawfulnesse,</hi> though not the <hi>necessity,</hi> which yet also is uncapable of any solid proof, till the <hi>lawfulnesse</hi> be first proved. This is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which I now charge as guilty of this fallacy (and not the <hi>deeming his faith certain</hi>) at the time when he so sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitously averts it. And this is all I need say to the first point, his <hi>deemed certainty,</hi> being in charity as well as civility ready to allow him to <hi>deem</hi> or <hi>believe</hi> (whatsoever his grounds are) whatsoever he affirms himself to <hi>deem</hi> or believe. And I hope he will anon do as much for me, who believe my <hi>faith</hi> as <hi>certain,</hi> as he can his, and have one ground more to believe it, (as anon will appear) than I see he means to have.</p>

To the second head also, the <hi>one ground,</hi> on which he is pleased to build his <hi>deemed certainty,</hi> that of <hi>universal Tradition,</hi> together with the notion in which he understands that phrase, the same which the <hi>Author</hi> of, and <hi>Apologist for Rushworths Dialogues</hi> hath of it, I have nothing to object in this place, knowing <hi>de facto</hi> that this <hi>is</hi> his <hi>ground,</hi> and allowing it as fit to support his <hi>deemed certainty,</hi> whil'st 'tis no more than <hi>deemed,</hi> as any other <hi>medium</hi> could be, for as long as he is granted to <hi>deem</hi> it, it matters not to our present debate, on what <hi>grounds</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:119753:21"/> he <hi>deems</hi> it. And indeed having first profess'd that he speaks now only of a <hi>deemed certainty,</hi> 'twas not needfull to adde at the same time upon what <hi>grounds</hi> he built it, the <hi>deeming</hi> being the <hi>onely</hi> thing, on which the reason (insisted on in this Section) was founded, and not the <hi>real,</hi> or grounded <hi>certainty.</hi> What therefore he hath for several pages inlarged, on this Theme of the <hi>grounds</hi> of his <hi>deemed certainty,</hi> I should think inserted by another hand, and not by him that was so carefull to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that he spake only of a <hi>deemed certainty,</hi> but that it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it might have another design, the <hi>amusing</hi> of the <hi>Reader,</hi> and the supplying some other <hi>vacuity</hi> in this reasoning, or the drawing of his adversary from the point in hand, to this other, wherein <hi>S.

For the third then (which alone is pertinent to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in hand) the <hi>necessity,</hi> and so <hi>duty</hi> consequent to this <hi>deemed certainty, of using the means and wayes which wit and art can invent to confute and discredit his adversaries harmfull Sophistry, and disparage his authority, as far as truth can justifie his words.]</hi> I shall bring it to a speedy issue by asking, Of what latitude is that phrase <hi>[the means and wayes that wit or art can invent?]</hi> Is it designed to take in, or not exclude <hi>all</hi> manner of means and wayes, that the most <hi>riotous wit,</hi> or <hi>forbidden arts</hi> can invent, or that the tropes of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> or good managery of words (be they never so <hi>contumelious</hi>) can yield toward the mention'd end, that of <hi>discrediting the adversary,</hi> &amp;c. only with that <hi>one</hi> restraint as <hi>far as truth can justifie his words?</hi> or is it no further to be inlarged, then all other <hi>Christian rules,</hi> as well as that one of truth, <hi>permit</hi> one private man to treat another? If he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119753:21"/> take it in the <hi>second</hi> sense, I grant it, and he hath gained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it, for I willingly yield him the freest exercise of the <hi>nimblest wit,</hi> and all <hi>lawfull arts,</hi> to <hi>discover,</hi> and so <hi>discredit</hi> any weaknesse in my defenses, but think not a multitude of <hi>contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies</hi> to be any of those <hi>lawfull,</hi> no nor so much as proper means toward that end, being only a <hi>cloud</hi> cast before the eyes of the <hi>Reader,</hi> to hinder his discerning any difference betwixt true, and pretended discoveries, betwixt <hi>boasts</hi> and <hi>victories.</hi> But if his indefinite words <hi>[the means and wayes]</hi> must be more largely extended in the first sense, I then deny that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>justice of a cause,</hi> be it a <hi>deemed,</hi> or a <hi>real certainty,</hi> can convert any the least or greatest <hi>sin</hi> into <hi>duty, christianize</hi> or consecrate <hi>contumely,</hi> though it should not have <hi>calumny</hi> joyned with it; and I hope I shall have no need of proving what is thus obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when the more excellent the cause is, the more it abhors and deems it self defamed and polluted by whatever <hi>unlawfull</hi> arts, and can no more justifie any one of them, than either want, or be gratified with them; <hi>Si malo religionem defendere velis, jam non defendetur illo, sed polluetur, atque violabitur,</hi> saith <hi>Lactantius.

Because he is not the judge of the <hi>truth</hi> of that which he endeavours to disprove, nor of the <hi>deserts</hi> of him whom he thinks himself <hi>obliged to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage.</hi>

Nor will the <hi>deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certainty of his own faith</hi> (the one medium of this Section) herein assist him, 1. Because a <hi>deemed certainty</hi> inferres not a <hi>real truth,</hi> and to suppose that without proof in time of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the <hi>begging of the question.</hi> 2.

The <hi>deemed certainty</hi> of <hi>his faith,</hi> the one medium in his present argument, is not sufficient to complete the parallel between them and me, the utmost that principle can assist or authorise him to deem of me, is, that I deny some few things to be true, which he <hi>deems certain,</hi> but neither that I deifie <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> nor <hi>deny Christ to have come in the flesh,</hi> nor <hi>offer sacrifice to Idols,</hi> nor joyn with the <hi>Jewes</hi> to persecute the <hi>Christians,</hi> nor <hi>forbid marriage,</hi> and set up unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural lust instead of it, nor profess'dly maintain <hi>Heathenisme,</hi> nor the worship of <hi>Baalim</hi> or dead <hi>Heroes,</hi> nor any thing which he can deem equivalent to all or any of these, which consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are necessary to make good his <hi>parallels.</hi> Neither 2. will that or any other imaginable medium make that lawfull to him, which was lawfull to <hi>Jude,</hi> or the <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> the first being an <hi>Apostle,</hi> the third a Prophet, and such as whose <hi>Spirit</hi> was interdicted the <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the second <hi>Governors</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in none of which capacities I discern <hi>S.

I had thought that the one thing, which such a

And no doubt such the nature of the consequential discourse may be, as the <hi>picking of thrums ends</hi> (to which he compares the producing of testimonies) may be an employment as highly dignified, and praise worthy, as that, and yet the deducing of a <hi>consequential ill practice</hi> from an <hi>ill prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> be still lesse <hi>laudable,</hi> because more blame-worthy than that.</p>

But my reply to this his reasoning will be sufficient, if instead of asking more, I only answer his one question in the parenthesis <hi>[else why should he proceed so reservedly?]</hi> by telling him that there are other very pregnant reasons of that kind of <hi>reservednesse,</hi> we now speak of (which consists, as the <hi>Archangels</hi> did, onely in abstaining from all <hi>contumelie,</hi> as well as <hi>calumny</hi>) beside the <hi>want of certainty in his faith,</hi> or the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension that the contrary is in any degree probable.</hi> As 1. a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious regard to the precepts of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> which expressely forbid <hi>contumely,</hi> and of which we have oft minded him. 2. A well-grounded opinion that truth is able to propugne and evidence it self by its own light, and wants not (as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines) <hi>plain terms,</hi> as those signifie <hi>revilings</hi> of his adversary, to <hi>let men know it is such.</hi> 3. The daily experience, that reason is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119753:24"/> most expedite in its motion to any sober dispassionate minde, when it comes like <hi>David</hi> with the <hi>Staffe in the hand,</hi> and the <hi>five smooth stones,</hi> and is not incumbred with <hi>Sauls Armour;</hi> And 4. an apprehension of that which is most obvious, that <hi>ruffling</hi> will not be interpreted solid <hi>confidence,</hi> but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousnesse of weaknesse, as we know he that <hi>dares</hi> fight, will seldome give any <hi>ill words,</hi> the <hi>tongue</hi> being not oft called in to the assistance, but to divert, and supply the place of the <hi>hands;</hi> and <hi>lastly,</hi> a dependance on <hi>God</hi> in his own way, that the means which he hath directed us to, will in fine be most successefull; which till <hi>S.

And this is all the advantage I mean to take (and not that other which he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to foresee) in that Paragraph.

If so, then I professe to allow him the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of such kind of <hi>zeal,</hi> as this, for I hope I shall never, whilest I am in my right wits, make use of it: If I would, I should have cut this whole Section of his short, by denying the <hi>ground</hi> of it, not only the <hi>certainty of his faith,</hi> but even his <hi>deeming it certain,</hi> for this is his dealing with me, contrary to what was visible to him.</p>

How he can think to excuse this his great <hi>moderation,</hi> that he hath not called me so many <hi>monsters</hi> and <hi>Demoniacks</hi> as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> did <hi>Vigilantius?</hi> how he hath made good the ingagements, under which he hath conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himself, both by standing to St. <hi>Hieromes award and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> and by acknowledging it <hi>necessary duty, if he hath any zeal and care of his conscience, to use the means, which wit and art can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent to discredit, disparage—as far as truth can justifie his words?</hi> Hath he not here resolved, that <hi>truth</hi> gives as much my <hi>due,</hi> as was payd to <hi>Vigilantius?</hi> with what <hi>care of his conscience</hi> then, if he were before in earnest, he could for the bribe of a few <hi>thanks</hi> (the utmost he demands) use this <hi>temper,</hi> and abstein from those obvious <hi>arts,</hi> and wayes, which <hi>St. Hierome</hi> had traced before him?] is my <hi>first question,</hi> not founded in what he hath <hi>really</hi> performed by way of <hi>temper,</hi> but what he <hi>saith</hi> he hath performed.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The <hi>second</hi> is, how he hath deserved my <hi>thanks</hi> for his <hi>moderation,</hi> when at the same time he tells me, there is as <hi>much due</hi> to me, on <hi>one score,</hi> as all St. <hi>Hieromes expressions</hi> amount to, and yet more <hi>accruing</hi> to me out of other <hi>titles?</hi> Doth he that tells a man publikely, that the title of <hi>frantick monster, prodigious monster, possess'd with the Devil, with an unclean Spirit, Snake, famous for wickednesse, block-head, &amp;c.</hi> (as <hi>S.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119753:30"/> him out of later titles,</hi> deserve his <hi>thanks,</hi> for not <hi>whipping him with Scorpions?</hi> What nice distinction hath he discovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>giving</hi> me these titles, and <hi>publickly</hi> telling me and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, they <hi>are due to me?</hi> 'Tis true indeed, that <hi>money</hi> is not <hi>payd,</hi> when 'tis only acknowledged <hi>due,</hi> but is it so in <hi>railing?</hi> Is it not one of the <hi>figures</hi> of that <hi>art,</hi> to tell his antagonist, this and this worst of <hi>titles is his due,</hi> yea much <hi>more also,</hi> than that, but he is kinde, and will not deal thus with him, as he <hi>deserves.</hi> And this piece of art, as all others, <hi>S.

I shall not therefore any farther reply to the parallel <hi>S.

Thus, either my <hi>cause</hi> is true, and then it is not <hi>laudable</hi> in him to use <hi>zeal</hi> against it, or to labour to oppresse it with <hi>noyse</hi> and <hi>clamour,</hi> or it is <hi>false,</hi> and then I cannot be so much repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for using no better means to defend it, then a bad cause is capable of. But I like not the last part of my <hi>dilemma</hi> much better than I did his, and therefore having only shewed him
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119753:31"/> the no force of it by this image, I answer, 1. That I take this cure for his <hi>begging the question</hi> to be palliate, and that it is still a <hi>begging the question</hi> to affirm, that either my <hi>cause is false,</hi> or that I have <hi>defended it with falsifications,</hi> and that I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in been so much as once <hi>discovered.</hi> There is a middle betwixt these, my having defended a <hi>true cause</hi> without any <hi>falsifications</hi> &amp;c. and till he hath not only said, but proved the contrary, which cannot yet be done in the beginning of this reply to my <hi>Discovery</hi> of his former <hi>Dexterities,</hi> his saying it, is the <hi>begging the question.</hi> 2. In case my <hi>cause</hi> were <hi>false,</hi> and his <hi>zeal lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> yet whether <hi>contumelies</hi> are that <hi>laudable zeal,</hi> or his <hi>twitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by the beard, pure zeal,</hi> and not <hi>contumely,</hi> is another <hi>question,</hi> at this present under debate, and therefore now in this Section most unskilfully <hi>begg'd</hi> by him. 3. Supposing the <hi>cause</hi> good, and some <hi>faults,</hi> and <hi>weaknesses</hi> discovered, in <hi>defending</hi> it, yet neither would it follow that those supposable <hi>faults</hi> were either <hi>frauds,</hi> or <hi>falsifications,</hi> or any way <hi>wilfull</hi> (which includes their being <hi>known</hi> to the author, as to me, I am sure, they are not) any more than the <hi>weaknesses</hi> are, which are generally most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to <hi>willfull,</hi> nor that they deserved as great a reprehension, be they what they can, as the like in maintaining a <hi>bad</hi> cause would deserve, the <hi>badnesse</hi> of the <hi>cause</hi> being allowable to adde some degree to the guilt, when the <hi>falsifications</hi> or whatsoever other crimes are supposed equal, and equally <hi>wilfull</hi> on both sides. 4.

That it is not otherwise than in this <hi>poetick</hi> Dialect, and in the Authors <hi>fancy,</hi> grown much more <hi>numerous</hi> since, I may safely collect from <hi>S. W.</hi> who, I suppose, hath narrowly observed the progress of this doctrin, and without respect to his interest true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told me, that <hi>few there are that have refined their understanding to this degree of discerningness, though he perceived</hi> to his comfort <hi>that the best sort of wits</hi> (himself, I suppose, and some, but still <hi>few</hi> others) which sure are not the most, <hi>begin</hi> (and do yet but <hi>begin</hi>) thus <hi>to own their reason.</hi> And for the latter 'tis no secret, that other of his tenets were not liked, if they had, they had not been, as himself in a second <hi>Epistle Dedicatory</hi> before that <hi>Apology,</hi> saith, <hi>so deeply censured even by Catholikes</hi> (whom he there cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

Disarm'd</hi> and <hi>Dispatcht,</hi> to enter the lists with that <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logist,</hi> is not yet accepted. It were not hard to make that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him, which would satisfie all disinterested persons of either party, but those having no need of, nor demanding that satisfaction, there is no hope of satisfying those <hi>few</hi> others, that are resolved it is <hi>beyond all possible refute,</hi> the <hi>deemed certainty</hi> of which perswasion layes on them a <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>concluding</hi> every thing <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and <hi>nonsensicall,</hi> that is aimed against it. 'Tis fitter then that these <hi>few</hi> should be permitted to enjoy their own humors, then that they should be studiously, but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently disquieted.

                  <p n="1">1. HIs fourth Section, the last on this subject, wherein his <hi>Defense,</hi> in relation to contumelies, is compleated, is the charging on me a <hi>grievous mistake committed in even ground, in a plain Epistle to the Reader.</hi> 'Twill cost us some circuit and windlace, to discern wherein this <hi>mistake</hi> consists. First he tells us the <hi>design of that his Epistle,</hi> to <hi>render the Reader an account, why the civility of his adversary should not hinder him from giving him his own, if the care of an eternal good interested his zeal to lay him open,</hi> and then addes the two <hi>parallel questions,</hi> which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in these words, <hi>How would you take it if one should spit in your face, and justifie the affront because his breath is sweet,</hi> &amp;c. And then again repeating his <hi>design</hi> in the <hi>questions,</hi> he <hi>reproaches me</hi> for <hi>not understanding it in my answer,</hi> (which yet was punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to his <hi>question,</hi> telling him how a <hi>Christian</hi> were bound to take it, if any <hi>man should spit in his face,</hi> were the <hi>breath swee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> or otherwise) To this rebuke I answer, 1. That if to a <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti n</hi> asked, I had given a punctual answer, abstracting from the main design of it, this might yet be farre from a <hi>grievous mistake.</hi> For unlesse the particularity of the <hi>design</hi> have such an influence on the <hi>question,</hi> that the answer to the <hi>question</hi> will be unsufficient, unlesse the <hi>design</hi> be explicitely taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, there is sure no <hi>mistake</hi> at all in this method.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But then 2. the <hi>answer</hi> which I gave, was perfectly home to the <hi>design,</hi> as well as to the <hi>question,</hi> which I shall thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119753:37"/> to him. The <hi>question</hi> I must suppose pertinent to the businesse in hand, and that was certainly for the justifying of <hi>S. W</hi>'s dealing in <hi>Sch. Dis.</hi> and that precisely in the point of <hi>rude blowes,</hi> or <hi>contumelies</hi> only, and not as 'tis now pretended, of <hi>giving the adversary his own</hi> (which is bare <hi>justice</hi>) or <hi>laying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, discovering the infirmities of his reasoning</hi> (which if it be no more then so, is <hi>justice</hi> again) This is most visible in the first words of the <hi>Epistle [I know you will be objecting that the blowes I give are too rude]</hi> (not that I <hi>give</hi> him <hi>his own,</hi> &amp;c.) Hence it followes that this, which he now pretends to have been his <hi>design,</hi> could then have no influence on the question, which was to justifie not his <hi>justice,</hi> but his <hi>rudenesse,</hi> and therefore my answer, which reflected only on <hi>rudenesse,</hi> not on <hi>justice,</hi> was home to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. So again for another ingredient in his <hi>design,</hi> the <hi>civility</hi> of his <hi>adversary,</hi> and the influence of that upon his <hi>blowes,</hi> that certainly I took notice of, and by proving to him from <hi>Christs</hi> command, that an <hi>uncivil</hi> adversary was not to be answered with <hi>rudenesse,</hi> I inferred with advantage, that a <hi>civil adversary was not thus to be answered. Lastly,</hi> for the <hi>care of an eternal good, interessing zeal,</hi> which is the last circumstance in his <hi>design,</hi> that only in my answer I took not notice of, and the reason is clear, because no such <hi>care</hi> can thus <hi>interesse zeal,</hi> as to justifie <hi>contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely.</hi> No mans <hi>eternal good</hi> depends upon <hi>S. W</hi>'s <hi>Contumelies,</hi> nor if it did, must he on that account neglect his <hi>own,</hi> as he certainly doth, that <hi>sins</hi> in order to the <hi>best</hi> end, and that the <hi>contumelious</hi> doth so, had a little before been proved, and was not there again to be insisted on. Let the Reader now, or, if he please, his own conscience judge, on whose side the <hi>grievous mistake</hi> lyes, on mine, who answered sully to the one true <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi> that <hi>rude blowes</hi> were <hi>not for any, much lesse for a civil adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or on his, that is now fain to substitute a <hi>fained design,</hi> and convert <hi>Rudenesse</hi> inhansed by the <hi>civility</hi> of the <hi>adversary,</hi> into exact distributive <hi>justice,</hi> which is known by this very form of words, <hi>suum cuique tribuere, giving every man,</hi> and so an <hi>adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, his own,</hi> which he could not <hi>know,</hi> as he said he did, <hi>his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> would <hi>object</hi> to him.</p>

W. <hi>to treat him tenderly, and favourably.]</hi> Let him now reflect on the first words of his <hi>Epistle;</hi> Was the Reader supposed to <hi>object</hi> that he did not <hi>treat the Doctor tenderly or favourably?</hi> Or had the style of the tract of <hi>Schisme</hi> courted <hi>favour</hi> or <hi>tendernesse</hi> from <hi>S.

                  <p n="4">4. But that he may indeed prove, that the <hi>Doctors wits were not well awake,</hi> he layes to my <hi>charge,</hi> that <hi>I neither go about to grant or deny the invalidity of those pretended excuses, which only was to be done]</hi> To which I have already answered, that <hi>contumelies</hi> being proved <hi>exterminating sins,</hi> 'twas evident none of those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended motives of them, could be imagined to have any force to <hi>justifie</hi> them, why then should <hi>I grant, or deny the invalidity of these,</hi> when upon the grounds promised, <hi>all</hi> were indifferently invalidated? When then in great vehemence he <hi>appeals to my conscience and reason, whether my answer taken from Christs rule of bearing of injuries, be any thing to this question, whether the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the breath justifie the affront of spitting in ones face,</hi> or, <hi>civil language sufficiently excuse pernicious Doctrine.]</hi> I answer him again, that neither of these were <hi>questions</hi> between him and me, or his <hi>Reader,</hi> but this only instead of them, whether <hi>rude blowes were a sutable return to a civil adversary,</hi> nay even to an <hi>uncivil,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>law of Christ?</hi> And I am sure my <hi>answer</hi> (and he cannot doubt it) was <hi>pertinent,</hi> and more than <hi>home</hi> to that <hi>question.</hi> This manner of dealing I desire may be entred into <hi>S.

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The answer to his second question,</hi> he saith, <hi>is yet more pleasant, for instead of telling whether swearing demurely be any excuse for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, so as to secure it from the punishment or treaty which otherwise

That as all <hi>lawfull means might be used to discover perjurie, and defend the estate, so unlawfull might not, and the rude blowes were of that number</hi> (the <hi>latter</hi> part of which being that, whereon the weight of the <hi>answer</hi> lay, he hath wholly omitted in his recitation, with what fairnesse, let him now judge.) 2. That this of <hi>demure perjury</hi> was far from the case of <hi>S. W</hi>'s adversary (whose <hi>civility</hi> was all that was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the <hi>objection</hi>) and who was as free from that, or any thing proportionable to that, as from <hi>Necromancy</hi> or <hi>sacrificing to Idols.</hi> And then what answer could be more pertinent, and <hi>home</hi> to the purpose, then this, that his plea for <hi>rude blowes,</hi> depending on the concession or supposition of <hi>two</hi> things, 1. That the adversary was guilty of <hi>perjury,</hi> or the like. 2. That <hi>rude blowes</hi> were a justifiable return to that, neither of these had any degree of truth in them. How this, that was thus plain, made a shift to be disguised, I leave the Reader to consider, and account with <hi>S. W.</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And when for the inflaming of the bill, he addes, that I <hi>mistook the similitude for the thing it is brought to resemble.</hi> I wonder
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119753:39"/> how he came to be so farre of my counsel; If I repeated the words, which he spake, and made answer in the same Dialect, and there was an <hi>allegory</hi> in his words, it is strange I may not be allow'd to have had the same in mine; Is my keeping <hi>close</hi> to his <hi>words,</hi> an evidence that I <hi>forsook his sense?</hi> If it be not, I am sure he hath no other from which to inferre it.

                  <p n="7">7. Of the same thred exactly is the next, that followes, and <hi>is,</hi> saith he, <hi>greater than all the rest, that when he made it his only plea to the Reader for some blowes— that our controversie was about things concerning mans eternal salvation, and therefore the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der knowing that he (as all Catholikes) hold their Faith certain, he had no reason to expect that S. W. should favour an opponent in an all of such a nature, as is publikely harmfull to mens souls, yet the Doctor takes no notice of this his plea.]</hi> But I answer, 1. That I did take notice of it, and assured him that I took it for a plain <hi>begging the question,</hi> to <hi>suppose that guilt which he was to prove, to assume so early, what he must, but hath not yet so much as attempted to demonstrate.</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:119753:39"/> 2. That if I had not taken notice of it, I had not in the least offended, as long as I had proved that <hi>Contumelies in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertist</hi> were simply unlawfull, for then no supposed truth, or weight of the cause could justifie them. The more <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> and important the <hi>cause</hi> were, the more it should confine it self to the use of means exactly <hi>Christian,</hi> and <hi>Contumelies</hi> were not such, and of these only the <hi>controversie</hi> was, though he now softens the matter, and asks whether he <hi>should favour an opponent in an act of such a nature, and that he would have little contention with me, were the difference in things of lesse concernment than eternity.</hi> But sure, 'twas not his <hi>favour</hi> was courted, nor his <hi>not contending,</hi> nor any thing expected of him, in return to <hi>civility,</hi> but what was ever under obligation of strict <hi>Christian</hi> duty to those who are <hi>uncivil,</hi> and if without all temptation he will break through those <hi>rational,</hi> as well as <hi>religious</hi> tyes, and pretend <hi>piety</hi> for doing so, and care of souls, and challenge me of wilfull mistakes, for not attending to his pleas, when he thus forsaketh his question, and substitutes another, which was never controverted, I foresee not, when I shall attain to any ordinary degree of his favour.</p>
                  <p n="8">8.

                  <p n="12">12. His other note, or branch of <hi>charge</hi> is more notable, making it an <hi>error</hi> in me, to pretend that he who was to <hi>answer, ought to prove,</hi> &amp;c. But I hope the <hi>Reader</hi> may be allowed to remember, what it was that I thought him bound to <hi>prove,</hi> even nothing else, but his charge of <hi>falsifying,</hi> which I deemed the lowest, which could bear any proportion with that of <hi>rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his estate by perjury.</hi> Of this 'tis evident I spake, when I said, <hi>I trust it shall appear, that there is not one single falsity in that whole tract of Schisme, and his supposing the contrary was the only petitio principii,</hi> which there I charged on him. And if now it be the priviledge of an <hi>answerer,</hi> that he may charge of <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifying,</hi> without <hi>proof</hi> of his charge, and may not have his charge denyed, or the proofs of it required, (which is all that is meant by telling him, he <hi>begges the question</hi>) and this upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of an <hi>answerer,</hi> and because to <hi>prove</hi> or <hi>demonstrate</hi> is to <hi>oppose</hi> and <hi>object,</hi> then I see there be other g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In either of these cases, more probable judgements are made by <hi>lesser</hi> characters, which are not so sure to be guarded by the disguiser, as are those, which he knowes are most visible. But I know such judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be deceivable, and the sagacity that <hi>Caesar</hi> had in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any period of <hi>Ciceroes,</hi> to have been farre greater, and more unerring, than I ever aspire to have of <hi>S.

If I shall now upon his bare word change my minde, and perswade my self that the <hi>Author</hi> of that <hi>Epistle</hi> was <hi>one of my old acquaintance,</hi> I am sure I shall be press'd with the same difficulty, not discerning it by the <hi>style</hi> to be penn'd by any such, and having other arguments of so much more force to the contrary, that unlesse Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> which really is one of mine <hi>old acquaintance,</hi> tell me he was the <hi>Author</hi> of that <hi>letter,</hi> or some othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I now see it was not really so <hi>great,</hi> nor so <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant an error</hi> (which <hi>p.</hi> 31. was in me accused as such) to <hi>mistake the comparison</hi> or <hi>similitude for the thing it is brought to resemble,</hi> or else 2. that <hi>S.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119753:43"/> truth, that <hi>he had time to take notice of it,</hi> it being competently certain, that the space of many moneths, which intervened between the one and the other is called <hi>time,</hi> and that that was afforded <hi>him,</hi> as well as any other; so that these two rebukes are of the strein of the many foregoing: Yet if in this <hi>Dispatch</hi> of his he shall be found to have made <hi>full</hi> returns to that <hi>whole Reply,</hi> the matter is not great; if he shall not, (as certainly I may have his leave to assume he hath not, having not offer'd any syllable to the latter half of it) then I have, under his hand here, his leave to conclude, that he <hi>deems it not likely to indam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage those dear souls of his brethren;</hi> And so all may be <hi>safely believed,</hi> which he hath not attempted to refute, and that will prove a farre <hi>greatest</hi> part of that book; Which is all I have need to say to these <hi>concluding</hi> charges.

                  <p n="5">5.

All power is in the Prince alone, and from a</hi> learned <hi>Lawyer Lotharius</hi> asserts, <hi>Principem esse fontem omnis jurisdictionis, that the Prince is the fountain of all Jurisdiction:</hi> citing the <hi>C. Quando vult Deus, Caus.</hi> 23. <hi>qu.</hi> 4. Thence he saith, the <hi>Reason</hi> is, <hi>why it is lawfull for the Prince sometimes to determine those things which concern the Church, least the honour of the Mother</hi> (the <hi>Church) should in any thing be violated. If any</hi> thing, saith he, <hi>be an Ecclesiasticall matter, that of convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Councels is certainly one, and yet 'tis the opinion of many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, that the Emperor may call a General Councel, so oft as he sees the Pope and Cardinals be noted of any suspicion, and neglect to do their duty, either for want of skill, or out of sinister intention, or peradventure of both, or when there is any schisme.</hi> He puts a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular case, <hi>The Pope calls the Bishops to</hi> Rome, <hi>or to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119753:78"/> place, the King forbids them to go, or commands them to come to his Court or Councel. The Bishops must,</hi> saith he, <hi>obey the Kings precept, and not only in this, but in any other matter whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, beside sin; for he that doth not observe his bounden fidelity to the King, whether Bishop, Priest, or Deacon, he ought to be ejected from his degree.</hi> This he proves by many <hi>Canons,</hi> and concludes his opinion to be, when the <hi>King calls together the Praelates to a Councel, and to reform the State of the Church, they are bound to obey, yea though the Pope forbid it.</hi> But this by the way.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. If I grant it, it is upon this security, that we have <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> as manifest, as matter of <hi>this</hi> nature will bear, and as <hi>rigorous</hi> as <hi>S.W.</hi> hath reason to exact of us, that the <hi>authority</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> praetended to, but was never <hi>possess'd</hi> of, in <hi>this</hi> Kingdome, viz. that of the <hi>Ʋniversal jurisdiction</hi> held to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him by <hi>Christ,</hi> was by him unduely praetended to, i. e. usurp'd; <hi>Mathematical,</hi> or <hi>Physical</hi> demonstrations, we
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:119753:87"/> suppose, the matter is not capable of, for there is no <hi>natural</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy in the terms, no <hi>common notions</hi> resisted, by affirming that the <hi>Pope</hi> should have such an <hi>authority,</hi> nay if it could appear that <hi>Christ</hi> ever promised him such <hi>authority,</hi> 'tis not only just that he should have it, but as necessarily concluded, that he hath had it, as it is conclusible that <hi>Christ</hi> cannot but perform his <hi>promise.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. And yet even of this sort, if <hi>S. W</hi>'s <hi>rigorous demonstrations</hi> might really passe for such (as <hi>ad hominem</hi> to <hi>S.

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119753:108"/> In this case I demand what other reason can be given, why, when I believe an article upon <hi>tradition</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> world, so farre a greater number of men to the <hi>contrary,</hi> should not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get some least <hi>dubitancy</hi> in my <hi>belief,</hi> thus founded, unlesse it be this, that the <hi>number</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> I have to depend on, is <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> to induce a <hi>faith</hi> so <hi>firm,</hi> that nothing of this kinde to the contrary can <hi>weaken</hi> it in the least degree; and if nothing of this kinde can <hi>weaken</hi> it, then by the same reason nothing of this kinde can <hi>strengthen</hi> it; the reason holding aequally on both sides. And that the <hi>Romanist</hi> will consent to this reasoning of mine, I have this ground to perswade my self, Because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> are, he knowes, disbelieved, upon the same ground of <hi>tradition,</hi> by a farre greater part of the <hi>Christian</hi> world (for I suppose I may style them part of the <hi>Christian</hi> world, whom yet he styles <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> the <hi>Greeke Church, Abassines, Georgians,</hi> and <hi>Protestants;</hi>) and yet this no way staggers or but gradually weakens his deemed <hi>infallibility;</hi> Why so?

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this Scheme, several things there are to which I shall in the obvious sense so farre yield, as not to make any imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent debate about them, As 1. that <hi>Tradition</hi> is the <hi>delivery of Christs Doctrine from hand to hand in that part of the world, which with propriety is called Christian,</hi> meaning by that phrase, all that have been <hi>baptized</hi> into the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and have not by some destructive, wasting <hi>superaddition,</hi> forfeited their title to that <hi>dignity;</hi> for that the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> that do not own to have ever received the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Popes Ʋniversal Pastorship</hi> from the <hi>Apostles, Saint Paul,</hi> and <hi>St. John,</hi> which planted some of them, (and have this real <hi>praejudice</hi> against it, that <hi>St. John,</hi> which long outlived <hi>St Peter,</hi> and by his <hi>Apostolical</hi> power was exempted from being <hi>inferior</hi> to any other, whether <hi>Clerus</hi> or <hi>Clemens,</hi> his <hi>Successors</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot reasonably be thought to have subjected <hi>his Successors</hi> to them, but should rather him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, being the <hi>surviving Apostle,</hi> be his <hi>Successor</hi> in that <hi>superemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> power, if any such had been given to <hi>Peter</hi> by <hi>Christ</hi>) should for the not believing or yielding that, be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged no <hi>Christians,</hi> or not <hi>Christians with propriety,</hi> but <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally</hi> and improperly called <hi>Christians,</hi> can never appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but by a convincing confirmation of the <hi>real</hi> delivery of that Doctrine to <hi>all,</hi> from all the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which if it were here meant to be praetended, is certainly as yet but <hi>praetended</hi> to be <hi>delivered</hi> from thence. The like must be said of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of other denominations, which are neither <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> yet have by <hi>uninterrupted Tradition</hi> received the <hi>necessary Faith</hi> in every branch of it, and retain it without the <hi>Roman</hi> additions, and though not the <hi>Papal,</hi> yet the <hi>Apostolical Gover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. So secondly, for the notion of <hi>Christs Doctrine,</hi> we scruple not to understand it of that, which was <hi>generally preached by the Apostles, and contains all such points as are necessary to the salvation of the world,</hi> and <hi>Government of the Church, and bringing multitudes with convenience to perfection in this life, and felicity in the next]</hi> meaning by <hi>[necessary to salvation] generally necessary,</hi> as an effective
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:119753:126"/> means to bring home sinners to <hi>repentance,</hi> to perswade them to a sincere reception of the Praecepts of <hi>Christ,</hi> as of the one certain way to <hi>aeternal</hi> salvation, without examining whether any particular man without the <hi>explicite</hi> knowledge of every single branch of that <hi>Faith,</hi> be capable of performing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and so of salvation on the <hi>Gospel</hi> terms, <hi>Gods accepting according to what a man hath, and not exacting what he hath not,</hi> and again by <hi>[perfection in this life]</hi> understanding <hi>sincerity</hi> of <hi>Evangelical obedience,</hi> styled often <hi>perfection</hi> in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> though in many respects it must be acknowledged <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. So thirdly, that <hi>all that Christ taught, or the holy Ghost sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, of this nature is by a direct uninterrupted line intirely and fully descended to the present Church, which communicates with, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges subjection to the Roman]</hi> Adding, that it doth so also and aequally to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in every particular, and so it is acknowledged by the <hi>Romanists</hi> to be intirely maintained by us, save only that we acknowledge not one link of their <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Government,</hi> that of the <hi>Roman supreme Ʋniversal Pastor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> which yet in these definitions hath not in the least wise been proved to be any (much lesse <hi>necessary</hi>) truth of <hi>Christs teaching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thus farre then there is no more asked, than granted by us, save only that of the <hi>Popes Ʋniversal Pastorship,</hi> and that no way inferrible from these praemisses, and consequently nothing gained from us by these so many steps of his <hi>fair me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. But then when he addes the <hi>converse</hi> of the last <hi>proposition,</hi> that <hi>nothing is so descended but such truths, nor any thing held by this tenure but what is so descended,</hi> there may be ambiguity in these propositions; For the first may be designed to signifie that no <hi>article</hi> is to this age of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> delivered down from the ages immediately precedent, upon the account of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Tradition,</hi> but what is both true and <hi>necessary</hi> to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; If this be the meaning of it, then he knowes 'tis deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, and must either be convincingly proved by him, or else there is a very <hi>weak, soft,</hi> unfortified part, which will be
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:119753:127"/> sure to <hi>betray</hi> all his <hi>demonstration,</hi> and being not here attempted to be proved in the proposal of the case, if it be not provided for in the last part of the method, the <hi>proving</hi> of his <hi>definition</hi> (which when we advance to that, we shall then examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be, or no) then that abundantly invalidates his whole <hi>Scheme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. But the proposition is capable of another sense, that <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is descended to the Church by such uninterrupted Tradition from the Apostles,</hi> but such <hi>truths</hi> as they, from the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> thought <hi>necessary;</hi> which though it have no truth in it, because many things may have been constantly received, and never doubted of by any <hi>Church,</hi> which yet have no such <hi>necessity,</hi> as that <hi>Christ</hi> lived to the age of thirty three years, and the like, yet because this seems not to me to have any influence on our <hi>present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,</hi> I shall not need to put in any exception to the <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> upon this ground of security, because the <hi>articles,</hi> which the <hi>Romanist</hi> holds necessary, and we do not, we hold not to have this continual <hi>succession.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. So the latter part of the <hi>converse,</hi> that <hi>nothing is held by this tenure but what is so descended]</hi> if the meaning be, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is by the <hi>Romanist maintained</hi> to have <hi>descended</hi> from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as <hi>necessary</hi> to be preached, and believed, but what hath thus <hi>really descended</hi> (as the obvious meaning is) then 'tis the main thing, which, he knowes, is, in this quaestion denyed by us, and that with great instance, specifying many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which no way appear to us to have descended from them, nor to have been by the <hi>Church</hi> look'd upon as <hi>necessary</hi> to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but visibly excluded out of the number of those articles, which alone are affirmed by the <hi>universal Church</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> great <hi>Councels</hi> to be thus necessary.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Lastly</hi> to his great <hi>Conclusion,</hi> if that should mean no more than that <hi>No error or false Doctrine was ever or can be received by the</hi> Universal <hi>Church</hi> truely so called, <hi>in quality of a matter of Faith,</hi> then though I have no assurance that it cannot, because the receiving an <hi>error</hi> by way of <hi>superaddition,</hi> and defining it <hi>de fide,</hi> is not sure to <hi>destroy,</hi> or inferre the <hi>defectibility</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> as long as they retain all the true <hi>fundamental Doctrine,</hi> yet
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:119753:127"/> again I am no way concerned to debate that, in relation to our <hi>praesent</hi> quaestion, because the receiving such <hi>errors</hi> into the <hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>Roman,</hi> is not receiving them into the <hi>faith</hi> of the <hi>Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church.</hi> But if the meaning be, that no error was ever, nor can be embraced by the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> in quality of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>faith,</hi> then he knowes, 'tis farre from being acknowledged by us. And this being probably the importance of his <hi>great conclusion,</hi> the falsenesse of it depends, and is consequent to the <hi>falsenesse</hi> of that foregoing <hi>proposition,</hi> interpreted, as I thought, and think it necessary that the sense carry it, <hi>viz.</hi> that no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle is to this age of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> delivered upon the score of <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> but what is both <hi>true</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> to be <hi>believed,</hi> and so also to the <hi>falsenesse</hi> of that other, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is by the <hi>Romanist</hi> maintained to have descended from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as <hi>necessary,</hi> but what hath thus really <hi>descended.</hi> And so the utmost that this rarely <hi>fair method</hi> of the <hi>Apologist</hi> hath yet produced, is no more than a few true propositions aequally granted by us, and of no least concernment to him against us, and one <hi>grand falsity,</hi> twice crept in to his <hi>definition</hi> (discernible enough to be such, as soon as <hi>ambiguous</hi> expressions are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted) and the <hi>conclusion</hi> naturally following the <hi>weakest</hi> part, most false in our opinion, and most evident to be by <hi>S.

And lest some might reply, though the present Roman Church stands now upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Maxim, yet anciently it did not, the same argument may be thus reiterated. If this principle which now governs the Church, had not alwayes done so, it must have been introduced in some age since the Apostles. Name therefore the age and immediately 'tis urged, either the Church had assurance in that age, all she held was descended lineally from the Apostles, or not. If so, then questionless she held her Doctrine upon that Maxim, for it is the only undoubted and self-evident principle, If not, then she willfully belyed her self, and conspired to damn all her posterity, voluntarily taking up this new rule of Faith, and commanding it to be accepted by all the world, as the necessary Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, descended upon the present age by Ʋniversal Tradition from their Ancestors, and for such to be delivered to their children, and all this against the expresse evidence of her own conscience.

For as long as she praetends only to this ground, the difficulty is aequal in each twenty years, i. e. there is an aequal impossibility they should conspire to this palpable lie. Now that they ever held to this ground</hi> (i. e. to the <hi>having received it from their Ancestors) is manifested by as great an evidence, For since they now hold this ground, if at any time they had taken it up, they must either have counterfeited that they had received it from their Ancestors, or no, The former relapses into the abovesaid impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility, or rather greater, that they should conspire to tell a lie in the only ground of their faith, and yet hold (as they did) their faith built on that ground to be truth: the latter position must discredit it self in the very terms, which imply a perfect contradiction, for
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:119753:132"/> it is as much as to say, nothing is to be held as certainty of faith, but what hath descended to us from our Fore-fathers, and yet the only rule which tells us certainly there is any thing of faith, is newly invented.</hi> And thus farre the argument also in <hi>S.

If he should mean that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth and hath alwayes acted according to this principle, then he cannot imagine that this will be allowed to passe as a <hi>principle</hi> without any attempt of <hi>proof.</hi> 'Tis certain they that charge the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>additionals,</hi> doe not <hi>believe</hi> or acknowledge that they have made no <hi>additions</hi> to the <hi>faith,</hi> but contend and specifie many particulars wherein they have <hi>innovated;</hi> And to answer them, that they do, and have alwayes acted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that <hi>maxim,</hi> is to prove they have not <hi>innovated,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have not <hi>innovated,</hi> and that is, I hope, the <hi>begging</hi> of the <hi>quaestion</hi> in the deepest tincture.

As in our <hi>English</hi> story he that could not confirm his new <hi>Revelations</hi> by <hi>miracles,</hi> endeavoured to do it by strong asseverations, and from thence proceeded to <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>execrations</hi> against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if it were not true which he delivered; And if either he or <hi>S.

                  <p n="25">25. Let us proceed to a third and last view, and demand, what is meant by <hi>not teaching de fide what hath not been delivered or taught—]</hi> Is it to be understood of <hi>teaching nothing as an article of faith,</hi> which was <hi>not delivered or taught as an article of faith</hi> by the <hi>foregoing</hi> age? There is a very considerable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between these two, <hi>delivering</hi> or <hi>teaching</hi> a thing as an <hi>opinion,</hi> and <hi>delivering</hi> or <hi>teaching</hi> the same as a <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>faith.</hi> And if by <hi>taught</hi> by the <hi>age immediately foregoing</hi> he mean only, <hi>taught</hi> as an <hi>opinion,</hi> then his <hi>maxim</hi> in plain terms is this, that no age of their <hi>Church</hi> defines any thing <hi>de fide,</hi> which was not before held as an <hi>opinion;</hi> And if that be it, then first he must own it as his <hi>confession,</hi> that his <hi>Church</hi> teaches what it hath not been <hi>taught</hi> by the foregoing age, for it teaches a thing <hi>de fide,</hi> or necessary to be believed, which the <hi>foregoing</hi> age taught not as such, 2. It concludes nothing to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but rather against him, <hi>viz.</hi> that propable opinions of their former <hi>Doctors</hi> are converted into matters of <hi>Faith</hi> by their <hi>latter.</hi> Thus 'tis evident, that all the <hi>Mothers,</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct their children out of <hi>Bellarmins Catechisme,</hi> assure them<note n="*" place="margin">

Besides he saith that the Latines did not receive Purgatory at once, but by little and little. Whence 'tis evident by the name Purgatory he means not only so much as is established in the Councel, but that the manner also and circumstances were introduced by revelations of private persons, and argumentations of Divines.

So that by speaking in general terms, and not distinguishing the substance of Purgatory from the accidents and dressing of it, as likewise in Indulgences not separating what the Church hath alwayes practised from the interpretative extension which Divines attribute to them, he is mistaken to suppose new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith may be brought into the Church, Neither imports it that he useth these words, No Orthod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

HIs <hi>twelfth Ground [that the Acceptation of the secular powers, and their command to the people, are necessary to the due and fitting execution of the Churches Lawes, whence followes not that the Princes made those Lawes by their own authority, but that they obeyed and executed what the Church had ordered]</hi> is made up of <hi>four pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi> the <hi>two</hi> first taken for <hi>granted,</hi> and so not endeavoured to be proved, the <hi>third</hi> founded in the <hi>supposal</hi> of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the <hi>fourth</hi> an expedient designed for the superseding the force of one sort of our proofs, those from the <hi>examples</hi> of our <hi>Princes</hi> making <hi>Lawes</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> but this of no apperance of force, save what is founded in the two <hi>unproved suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The supposals are somewhat immoderate, 1. that all the <hi>commands</hi> of the <hi>secular power</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> matters, are but effects of their <hi>acceptation</hi> of the <hi>Churches Lawes,</hi> and 2. that they are only in order to the <hi>execution</hi> of them; The <hi>third</hi> which is founded in <hi>supposal</hi> of these <hi>two,</hi> and hath not so much
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:119753:157"/> as a <hi>poss ble ideal</hi> being, abstracted from that <hi>supposal,</hi> is, that <hi>supposing</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> to be the only <hi>Law-giver,</hi> and that 'tis the <hi>Princes</hi> part only to <hi>accept</hi> their <hi>Lawes,</hi> and by <hi>civil sanction</hi> to command the execution of them, this <hi>acceptation</hi> and command of the <hi>secular powers</hi> are very convenient and <hi>necessary</hi> to the <hi>bene esse,</hi> the <hi>due and fitting execution of the Churches Lawes.</hi> All which if yielded by us, the <hi>Corollary</hi> would indeed be natural enough, that the <hi>Princes Lawes</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> matters cannot be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by us to be of their <hi>own authority,</hi> but on the contrary, of <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>subordination</hi> to the <hi>Church.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4.

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. And for the <hi>second,</hi> 'tis as manifest that all that his expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

                  <p n="6">6. Another <hi>fallacy</hi> there is in the <hi>ambiguity</hi> of the word <hi>[acceptation]</hi> which is expressely used by <hi>S.

                  <argument>
                     <p>His thirteenth Ground. Concessions of the Church] ambiguous. The Popes acknowledged subjection. No testimony of the Popes conferring on Princes the powers which they execute.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. THe <hi>thirteenth Ground</hi> [that <hi>it is granted by Catholikes, that Kings may exercise some Ecclesiastical jurisdiction by the concession of the Church, and yet not praejudice thereby the Popes Ʋniversal Pastorship</hi>] is of the same piece with the former, from a bare <hi>possibility</hi> that the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</hi> in <hi>Princes</hi> should have been <hi>granted</hi> to them by the <hi>Church,</hi> to whisper the unconcludency of those manifest <hi>testimonies,</hi> which relate the <hi>Princes</hi> exercise of <hi>Ecclesiastical power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But here is a double ambiguity in the phrase <hi>[Concession of the Church]</hi> for as by the <hi>Church</hi> may be meant either the <hi>Ʋniversal Church,</hi> or the <hi>Pope</hi> their <hi>supposed head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> so by <hi>[concession]</hi> may be meant either <hi>granting</hi> and <hi>conferring</hi> a power originally vested in him that grants it, and only from him <hi>derived</hi> to the other; or else the <hi>acknowledging</hi> it to be his <hi>proper due,</hi> that claims it, and willingly <hi>allowing</hi> it, and praetending nothing against it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If now in the first place we should understand it of the <hi>Ʋniversal Church acknowledging Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</hi> to be due to <hi>Princes,</hi> this is certainly a competent <hi>evidence,</hi> that thus 'tis <hi>due,</hi> and so must be a <hi>praejudice</hi> to the <hi>Popes Ʋniversal Pastorship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if the <hi>Pope</hi> himself shall thus acknowledge, as I suppose * <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> doth, when he tells <hi>Mauritius, Ego jussioni tuae subjectus eandem legem per diversas terrarum partes transmitti feci,</hi> that he is <hi>subject to his command,</hi> and as such, <hi>causes</hi> his <hi>Law</hi> to be <hi>promulgated,</hi> and in the other forecited

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if in the notion of <hi>concession</hi> for <hi>conferring</hi> or <hi>deriving</hi> by <hi>grant</hi> a power to another, it should appear (as it doth not) that the <hi>Ʋniversal Church</hi> hath <hi>granted exercise</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</hi> to <hi>Princes,</hi> yet even that would be <hi>praejudicial</hi> to the <hi>Popes Ʋniversal Pastorship,</hi> for in that case if the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Councel</hi> did no more than they had <hi>power</hi> to doe, the <hi>Church</hi> (and that is not the <hi>Pope</hi>) must have that <hi>power,</hi> or else it could not conferre it on the <hi>Princes,</hi> and if it have it, it is above the <hi>Pope,</hi> and that is unreconcileable with the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> or <hi>Pastorship</hi> over <hi>all.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the confirmation of this <hi>ground,</hi> he addes that the <hi>Testimonies by me alleadged from the Church in her Councels granting jurisdiction to the secular power is a strong praejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their self and proper right</hi>] he is very farre from <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating</hi> or even <hi>probable</hi>-speaking, for if by <hi>granting</hi> he meant <hi>acknowledging</hi> the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> in the <hi>saecular power,</hi> then (as hath been said) 'tis as convincing a proof of it, as the <hi>testimony</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is of any <hi>right,</hi> or <hi>truth,</hi> and sure that cannot be converted to a <hi>praejudice against</hi> it, but if it should be (which it no where appears to be) a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring</hi> of it, then still it appears that 'tis not <hi>conferred</hi> on them by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and consequently that 'tis not <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally</hi> vested in him, and then he is not the <hi>Ʋniversal Pastor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Lastly,</hi> if (which is the only thing for <hi>S.

                     <hi>Rome,</hi> came to terms of accord, and a day was fix'd, and a <hi>Currier sent for receiving from our King a Confirmation hereof within a set time,</hi> but the <hi>Currier</hi> not returning till two dayes after that time was expired, the <hi>sentence</hi> was <hi>praecipitated,</hi> and the <hi>censures fulminated,</hi> and then the <hi>Currier</hi> arrived with <hi>ample Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> and <hi>authority from the King to conclude and confirm all that the Bishop had agreed in his name.</hi> But what was that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?

                  <argument>
                     <p>Answere to his seventh Section. Admiration and Prodigy relative. <hi>S. W</hi>'s guesses not creditable against our knowledge. Our denying a Fact is not our pleading the reasonablenesse of it: Not inflicting Censures differs much from joyning with Schismaticks. <hi>S. W</hi>'s inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of not pressing false Fundamentals. His averting our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to their Church. What danger if our charity erred? An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our belief that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church. The Nagges-head Bishops. With what truth that Fable is now revived. Mission from <hi>Rome</hi> in what sence.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. IN his seventh <hi>Section</hi> the <hi>mistakes</hi> affix'd on me in <hi>reply</hi> to his <hi>Introduction,</hi> will not move any man that shall compare <hi>Dexter.</hi> ch. 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. with these suggestions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For example, it being the part of a <hi>wise man, nil admirari,</hi> to <hi>admire nothing,</hi> and <hi>new</hi> and <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>prodigious</hi> effects being the only things for which <hi>admiration,</hi> which hath gone for an <hi>excesse</hi> of <hi>minde,</hi> is allowable or excusable, and yet <hi>S. W.</hi> own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>some admiration</hi> to have been <hi>bred</hi> in him, I know not that I could misinterpret him, when I conceived some <hi>great unheard of newes</hi> and <hi>prodigy</hi> to be the one proper <hi>object</hi> of such <hi>acknowledged admiration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As for the account of our writing <hi>books</hi> by <hi>pairs</hi> (he may now remember Sir <hi>Roger Twisden,</hi> and <hi>Dr. Ferne</hi> and say by <hi>Messes</hi>) on the subject of <hi>Schisme,</hi> I must be allowed to give the <hi>reasons</hi>
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:119753:171"/> with more certain judgement than any else, but the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Derry,</hi> and those others, and the <hi>searcher</hi> of <hi>hearts;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he will still satisfie himself with his own <hi>auguries,</hi> and set up his <hi>phansie</hi> for an <hi>infallible</hi> testifier, against other mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errable <hi>sensations</hi> of a <hi>fact</hi> within their own <hi>cognisance,</hi> I shall leave him and his Reader to try it out, and not endeavour to make this impertinent breach betwixt us <hi>wider</hi> by debating.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So when I take notice of his mention of <hi>our pleading the reasonablenesse of our own Schisme, as a</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, what <hi>trust is due to him in his affirmations,</hi> he will perswade me that I interpret his words, <hi>as if he meant, that I confess'd it Schisme]</hi> But it is evident to any <hi>Reader,</hi> that reflects on my words (<hi>Answ.</hi> to <hi>Sch. Dis. Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. n. 1.) that I doe not so <hi>interpret</hi> his words, but only assume, that he saith (which are his <hi>expresse</hi> words) <hi>that we plead the reasonablenesse of our Schisme,</hi> and answer, that I <hi>grant all Schisme uncapable of all plea of reasonablenesse, and maintain our innocence by denying the fact, and not by defending the justice of it.</hi> And therefore although herein he either is, or desires others should be deceived (for my exception is still the <hi>same</hi> that it was, that we <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>fact,</hi> have not <hi>divided,</hi> or <hi>brake</hi> from any <hi>Government,</hi> that we were under, and then how can I be supposed to plead the <hi>reasonablenesse</hi> of that <hi>fact,</hi> which he calls our <hi>Schisme,</hi> if I think we never committed that <hi>fact?</hi> and if we had, I confesse we could not produce any justifiable <hi>reason</hi> for it) yet the farther discussing this, were but the <hi>repeating</hi> what hath been so oft said, that we plead not (as he oft, and fain would have us) the causes of our <hi>division</hi> (but deny that we ever <hi>divided</hi>) and that all the <hi>breach</hi> or <hi>partition</hi> that is made, proceeds from their sentences of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> as <hi>inexorable,</hi> as <hi>unjust.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. So in his Reply concerning the <hi>aim</hi> and end of the <hi>Churches censures,</hi> 'tis so visible I spake not of our <hi>not keeping our selves sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> from <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> on one side, nor of the <hi>punishments sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to Excommunication,</hi> on the other side, but of that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, whereof he spake before, <hi>viz.</hi> the whether <hi>inflicting</hi> or <hi>threatning</hi> them with the <hi>Spiritual rod of Excommunication</hi> (which were little lesse than <hi>fury</hi> toward a <hi>Schisme armed with might,</hi>
                     <pb n="333" facs="tcp:119753:171"/> and so, farre from <hi>Christian,</hi> or <hi>charitative,</hi> or <hi>prudent</hi>) that it is not imaginable he can expect farther answer to his suggestions, than is already largely afforded him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. His next piece [of their <hi>not pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ssing us to believe false funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi>] as it is now interpreted by him, must signifie a special rarity, <hi>viz.</hi> his telling me, that they <hi>doe not presse us to believe false fundamentals,</hi> meaning by <hi>fundamentals,</hi> as he saith, <hi>such points as we account fundamentals]</hi> which being easily spelled, and put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, amounts to this, that they doe <hi>not presse us to believe such false points, as we accounted fundamentals,]</hi> On which I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my discourse too short to make any rational reflexions, I am no <hi>Oedipus</hi> for such riddles, but acknowledge, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I was so charitable as to think he spake words that would hear some <hi>sense,</hi> I affix'd not <hi>this</hi> interpretation on them, and so it is but a faint sparkling of <hi>S. W</hi>'s more radiant esprite, to demand now, whether it <hi>were wrong to us to affirm that we would not speak a contradiction]</hi> No, but it was, it seems, <hi>superabundant charity</hi> in me to praesume he would not.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Meanwhile 'tis possible one passage in this discourse of the <hi>truth</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> p. 63. may breed some scruple, how I can acknowledge the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> a <hi>true Church,</hi> when I deny their <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which he here, as elsewhere, affirms to be the <hi>Fundamental of Fundamentals, upon which as her sole certain ground she builds all her Faith.</hi> Upon which his argument thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, <hi>If the sole Authority on which she builds all her faith, to wit, her infallible authority, be a ruinous falshood, she can have no true faith of any Article, and consequently can have no faith at all, nor be a true Church, since a Church cannot survive the destruction of faith,</hi> whence he concludes, that <hi>our ambition to honour our Nagges-head Bishops with the shadow of a mission from their Church makes us kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speak nonsense to doe Rome a seeming courtesie for our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. To all this therefore I must pay some attendance, and <hi>first,</hi> to reflect a while on his plain affirmation, that <hi>their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is their fundamental of Fundamentals, their sole certain ground on which she builds all her faith.]</hi> I may here have leave with some astonishment to demand, if <hi>Gods veracity,</hi> his <hi>word</hi> and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:119753:172"/> certain <hi>truth</hi> of his affirmations, be not at least some <hi>part</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> if not the <hi>foundation</hi> of it? and if they <hi>believe that</hi> only upon their own <hi>infallibility,</hi> and not their <hi>infallibility</hi> on that? 2. Whether she may not aequally build on this <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> all things in the world, which she can or shall ever believe, as she builds those <hi>articles</hi> which she now professeth? But this theme is too large for a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and hath in an intire tract, been long since considered.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Secondly</hi> then for our destroying their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> by denying their <hi>Infallibility,</hi> I shall return answer, such as I hope will justifie the reason of our <hi>charity</hi> toward them, though they should all be such passionate, avowed, impersuasible, and even <hi>Platonick lovers</hi> of hatred and strife, as <hi>S. W.</hi> affects to be esteemed, most vehemently renouncing their <hi>thinking of our Church under that notion,</hi> when they <hi>pray for the peace of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church,</hi> p. 78. and giving his reason why we should not have <hi>charity,</hi> or <hi>con thanks</hi> to the <hi>humble members of the Papacy</hi> for such <hi>prayers,</hi> and so here sollicitously providing, and proposing <hi>arguments</hi> to avert our <hi>charitable</hi> acknowledgement that their <hi>Church</hi> is a <hi>true Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. And 1. I might demand, what <hi>injury</hi> it would be to their <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>criminous</hi> error in us, if a few poor persecuted <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> being railed at for <hi>haereticks,</hi> and cast out of their <hi>Church,</hi> did so farre deceive themselves by their earnest desire to <hi>live peaceably with all men,</hi> and to <hi>repay good for evil,</hi> as without grounds <hi>demonstrable,</hi> or duely approveable, to <hi>hope</hi> or <hi>believe</hi> better of them than they deserve, or than they are willing we should perswade our selves, or others, that they deserve? Or how were it reconcileable with <hi>humility</hi> in them, to reject these no poysonous effluxions of this, <hi>easie, well-meant,</hi> (though 'twere <hi>irrational) charity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. But then 2. we doubt not of the <hi>solidity</hi> of our grounds, whereby we conclude the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> a <hi>true Church,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received and retained the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Apostles Crede,</hi> the <hi>one only true faith, once,</hi> or <hi>at once delivered.</hi> And if they do also believe the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>present Roman Church,</hi> which we account an <hi>error,</hi> yet will not that (or their many other <hi>additional</hi>
                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:119753:172"/> errors) be sufficient of it self to destroy the <hi>foundation</hi> supposed to be believed by them, any more than telling <hi>many</hi> falsities is unreconcileable with telling <hi>any</hi> truth.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. As for his argument, founded in the <hi>supposal</hi> that <hi>she builds all her faith on her own Infallible authority,</hi> my charity still bids me hope that she doth not, but upon the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and therefore that the <hi>Church,</hi> in this argument, is an ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous word, distinguishable into the <hi>ancient, Primitive, Apostolical Church truely Ʋniversal,</hi> and the <hi>present modern Roman Church</hi> falsely styling it self <hi>Ʋniversal;</hi> and then as I doubt not but the former of these was <hi>infallible</hi> in <hi>testifying</hi> their own <hi>sensations,</hi> and so in delivering down both the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>articles</hi> of the <hi>Crede,</hi> so I charitably perswade my self, that the <hi>present Roman Church</hi> believes both these upon that <hi>Testimony</hi> of theirs, and then that as including the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and so <hi>God</hi> himself, is their <hi>Fundamental of Fundamentals,</hi> their <hi>sole certain Ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. As for their <hi>present Church,</hi> as farre as it teaches no more, than it received from them, so farre it proceeds <hi>infallibly</hi> also, but hath not it self that <hi>amulet</hi> or <hi>charme</hi> of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> that although it should <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>teach,</hi> as received from them, what really they never delivered, it should yet be <hi>unerrable</hi> in thus <hi>believing,</hi> or affirming.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And this (if there be any kinde of truth in such as do not praetend to be <hi>infallible</hi> in all things) is the true ground of our believing them still a <hi>true</hi> (yet not an <hi>infallible) Church,</hi> though how soon they will make use of their <hi>praetended infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to destroy some <hi>articles</hi> of the <hi>Faith,</hi> as they have done to introduce those that are <hi>no articles,</hi> I undertake not to divine, yet conceive that the divolving the whole <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>saith</hi> to the <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> of each present age, and defining for <hi>Articles,</hi> whatsoever the <hi>present Mothers</hi> shall teach their <hi>children,</hi> is as ready a way toward it, as the Devil could civilly suggest, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still into them; But the no great <hi>reverence</hi> I owe to <hi>S. W</hi>'s <hi>affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> leaves still place for my <hi>charity,</hi> to believe that there be but <hi>few Romanists</hi> as yet, that have entred into this <hi>temptation.</hi> And untill it be formed into an <hi>article,</hi> and these <hi>possible</hi>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:119753:173"/> noxious consequences be <hi>actually</hi> and practically derived from it, I shall still hope that the taking up all true <hi>fundamental articles,</hi> on what grounds soever, though from a book casually found among <hi>Heathens,</hi> much more from <hi>Romish Mothers</hi> (though they neither are, nor are deemed <hi>infallible</hi>) may, with the superstructing of <hi>good</hi> life, bring safe to heaven him who hath no other means to direct him thither.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. For I shall demand, in case a <hi>Christian Priest</hi> or but a <hi>Lay</hi> person, should goe to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and there promulgate the <hi>true Doctrine,</hi> or (to satisfie <hi>S. W.</hi>) the <hi>whole Roman</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Tridentine Articles,</hi> telling them withall, that <hi>God</hi> came to him in a <hi>Vision,</hi> and revealed this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and with it gave him this command, to preach it to those <hi>Auditors,</hi> and in case those <hi>Indians believe</hi> all that he saith, his <hi>Vision,</hi> and his <hi>Doctrine</hi> too, his <hi>Vision,</hi> which I with <hi>S. W.</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be a <hi>Falsitie,</hi> and his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which <hi>S. W.</hi> grants with my supposition to be a <hi>truth,</hi> shall not, I say, those <hi>Indians,</hi> that thus <hi>believe</hi> all <hi>Catholike truth,</hi> be acknowledged to have a <hi>true Faith,</hi> and if by that <hi>Priest</hi> they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into this <hi>Catholike Faith,</hi> be thus farre accounted <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> in a state of <hi>salvation,</hi> if without ever discovering the falsenesse of the praetended Vision, they die in that <hi>Faith?</hi> I shall not think <hi>S. W.</hi> so severe to these new <hi>Proselytes,</hi> as to doubt of their <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Salvability.</hi> And I shall have the same <hi>charity</hi> to him and his <hi>Church,</hi> if as <hi>sincerely,</hi> as the supposed <hi>Indians,</hi> they <hi>believe</hi> all <hi>Catholike</hi> truth, and as <hi>blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely,</hi> as those <hi>Indians,</hi> continue to <hi>believe</hi> some <hi>untruths.</hi> So much may suffice for this objection.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. To his mention of the <hi>Nagges-head Bishops</hi> I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to return, but that it seems these are times, wherein the most <hi>refuse</hi> trash, the most <hi>scandalously reprobate</hi> ware may hope to be put off to some Customers, else this which was long since driven to its <hi>den,</hi> and discovered to be <hi>palpable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery</hi> by testimony of undenyable <hi>records,</hi> would not adventure the <hi>shame</hi> of coming upon the Stage again, as both here by <hi>S.

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:119753:173"/> attribute ought to the <hi>one</hi> auxiliary, newly brought in, the praetended <hi>Confession</hi> of the <hi>Bishop of Durham</hi> in the <hi>late Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> he will soon see (if not before this can tell him so) from evidences undenyable, what sort of <hi>wares</hi> those are▪ which now a dayes the <hi>Romanist</hi> serves out to his <hi>Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. Meanwhile <hi>S.

Her fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility in others competible with making decisions. Of inferiors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescing only.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. HIs 11<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Section proceeds to a large review of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning Mr. <hi>Knots concession,</hi> which being a meer <hi>digression</hi> both of the <hi>Cath.

I had before that of <hi>Schisme</hi> written a large Treatise of dispute with <hi>Mr. Holland</hi> upon that subject of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which I was not therefore to repeat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, 2. with that part of my discourse which only considered <hi>Mr. Knots concession,</hi> that it was <hi>lawfull to separate or continue in sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Church of Christ, in case we could not without lying be permitted to communicate with it]</hi> 'tis as evident this hath no immediate <hi>connexion,</hi> and so must be look'd on as a <hi>digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. This might passe for full answer to the whole <hi>Section,</hi> being a competent reason, why I should no longer insist on

It is in his book <hi>de vero usu Patrum,</hi> p. 278. 279. where speaking of <hi>St. Hieroms</hi> manner of treating his <hi>adversaries,</hi> how he <hi>drawes their sayings beyond their sense, and affixes most remote meanings to them, which are not in their words, and then sets upon them most hostilely with contumelies, stinging speeches—</hi> gives an instance first in his dealing with <hi>St. Augustine,</hi> and then with <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> the former, saith he, <hi>he gibes as sarcastically and wittily as he can,</hi>

                  <p n="41">41. In the beginning of this <hi>Epistle</hi> we finde <hi>quod aliqui murmurant dicentes quomodo Ecclesiam Constantinopolitanam disposuit comprimere</hi>— Here it seems the <hi>Popes</hi> dealing with <hi>Constantinople</hi> is disliked, and <hi>murmured</hi> at by some, and his whole account for it is given in these words, that <hi>the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and Eusebius a Bishop of the same City, daily profess'd</hi> it, and therefore <hi>none can doubt but 'twas subjected to him.</hi> Which in any other sense, than what we have delivered in answer to the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:119753:211"/> former testimony (unlesse perhaps in point of <hi>place</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>dignity,</hi> wherein the <hi>Pope</hi> by the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> was allowed the <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> the second place) cannot be imagined to have any truth in it.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. For 1. I demand, Who was this <hi>Eusebius Bishop of the same City?</hi> If we can believe <hi>S.

All this is most evident, and assures us there was no <hi>Eusebius Bishop</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to make <hi>daily</hi> acknowledgements of <hi>subjection</hi> to <hi>Gregory,</hi> and so though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of <hi>historical</hi> directions would not, yet the want of it may make a shift to make <hi>wordish testimonies</hi> unintelligible.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. Secondly, 'tis as evident by all <hi>Gregories Epistles,</hi> that the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> resisted him all his time, and were resisted by him; <hi>John</hi> being the man that assumed the title of <hi>Ʋniversal.</hi> And besides, what possibility is there, that this <hi>Church</hi> should at this time <hi>professe subjection</hi> to <hi>Gregory,</hi> which was so lately raised to <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="44">44. It remains therefore, that the <hi>subjection</hi> spoken of, as <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd</hi> both by <hi>Eusebius</hi> the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and the <hi>Emperor,</hi> must be 1. no <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> 2. no more then of <hi>subjecting</hi> him in a particular cause, to <hi>St. Gregories</hi> cognisance, no <hi>subjecting</hi> him to his <hi>ordinary</hi> or <hi>real Jurisdiction,</hi> much less 3. any <hi>supreme jurisdiction</hi> of <hi>divine</hi> right from <hi>Christ,</hi> which alone serves <hi>S.

                  <p n="46">46. I should not propose this, if it were imaginable, there should be any such man so called, <hi>Patriarch,</hi> and, in that notion, <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> at that time, And therefore if any shall dislike this proposal, I wish he would shew the contrary recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable with <hi>story.</hi> But if he cannot, then what other truth can there be in <hi>Gregories</hi> words, but this, that the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and that <hi>Bishop,</hi> most probably the <hi>Metropolitane</hi> of a City (and <hi>Primate</hi> of a <hi>Region</hi> under the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi>) viz. of <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> did <hi>daily professe that the Church of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople was subjected to the Apostolick See;</hi> Which as it is not the acknowledgement of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> himself, on which alone <hi>S.

But first the words are these, <hi>Nunquid non ipse nosti quia in causâ quae a Johanne Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero contra Johannem Constantinopolitanum fratrem &amp; coepiscopum nostrum orta est, secundum Canones ad sedem Apostolicam recurrit, et nostrâ est sententiâ definita?

                     <hi>Answer</hi> is short, but yet somewhat <hi>extraordinary, Those words, Nec etiam Romanus Pontifex Vniversalis est appellandus, are not,</hi> saith he, <hi>found either in the Councel of</hi> Carthage <hi>it self, or in the ancient Copies, but are Gratians addition only, wherefore they are to be understood in the sense wherein Pope</hi> Pelagius <hi>took them, whose Epistle he cites to make good those words.]</hi> I dare say never any <hi>wit</hi> did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice an higher piece of <hi>self-denyal</hi> for the avoiding the force of a <hi>wordish testimony,</hi> than is here discoverable.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. For 1. what should he project in this subtile observation, that <hi>those words, Nec etiam Romanus Pontifex—are not found in the Councel of Carthage it selfe?]</hi> Did any man cite them from that <hi>Councel.</hi> 'Tis certain I did not. My words are visible, <hi>Repl.</hi> p. 40. n. 10. [<hi>But to return to their Corpus Juris, so again Decret. par.</hi> 1. <hi>Dist.</hi> 99. c. 4. <hi>Nec etiam Romanus Pontifex Vniversalis est appellandus, the Pope of Rome is not to be called universal Bishop, citing the Epistle of Pope Pelagius the</hi> II.—] 'Tis then <hi>Corpus Juris,</hi> i. e. <hi>Gratians collection</hi> that I cite, and that is not the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Carthage.</hi> And it is as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that that <hi>Corpus,</hi> or <hi>Gratian</hi> cite not the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> in that place, but the <hi>Pope Pelagius.</hi> Who then is it that thus cited it, and was therefore thus to be refuted, by reminding him that the <hi>words are not found in the Councel of Carthage?</hi> Sure none but <hi>S. W</hi>'s <hi>own</hi> phansie, that can connect any things most distant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:119753:214"/>
                     <hi>Pelagius</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> rather than not adde a 7<seg rend="sup">th</seg> answer to an argument that lay upon his hands.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. <hi>Secondly,</hi> what should he mean by the <hi>ancient Copies?</hi> the <hi>ancient Copies</hi> of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Carthage?</hi> So it must be, if it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any thing. And then 1. what need was there of that <hi>addition?</hi> What other image can we have of that <hi>Councel,</hi> held so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our time, than by the <hi>ancient Copies</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> of it? when therefore he had said [it was <hi>not found in the Councel it self</hi>] the Reader would well enough have understood his meaning, that so it was not <hi>found</hi> in the <hi>ancient Copies</hi> of it, I divine not what tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable account can be given of this <hi>addition,</hi> unlesse he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us, that having found it in some <hi>later</hi> Copies of that <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,</hi> yet searching the <hi>ancient,</hi> he found it <hi>missing</hi> there; And that were very fine, when, as hath been said, it is not so much as cited, or praetended to be fetch'd from any either <hi>old</hi> or new <hi>Copies</hi> of that <hi>Councel,</hi> but from <hi>Gratians collection</hi> out of a <hi>Popes Epistle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="57">57. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> with what truth can it be said, that it is <hi>Gratians addition only?</hi> If he knowes what belongs to the <hi>Corpus Juris,</hi> he must discern, that those words <hi>[Nec etiam Romanus Pontifex Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versalis est appellandus]</hi> are the title of the 4<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                     <hi>Chapter,</hi> that <hi>title</hi> written by <hi>Gratian,</hi> the <hi>Chapter</hi> it self being the proof of it, from a <hi>testimony</hi> in <hi>Pelagius</hi>'s <hi>Epistle,</hi> to which yet it can be no <hi>addition,</hi> because the words of the <hi>Epistle</hi> unavoidably inferre it, <hi>Nullus Patriarcharum universalitatis vocabulo unquam utatur—Let none of the Patriarchs ever use the name of Vniversal</hi>— applying this in the conclusion to himself, being then <hi>Pope,</hi> as one of that number. And so, if he were <hi>Romanus Pontifex,</hi> and he might not be called <hi>Vniversalis,</hi> or if he were a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> and no <hi>Patriarch</hi> might be called <hi>Vniversalis,</hi> then sure here was nothing added by him, that said <hi>[Nec etiam Romanus Pontifex, not even the Bishop of Rome must be called Vniversal Bishop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="58">58. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if they were <hi>Gratians addition only,</hi> as he saith they were, how can he say, <hi>they are to be understood in the sense wherein Pope</hi> Pelagius <hi>took them?</hi> Did then <hi>Pope Pelagius</hi> use them? so he must, or he could not take them in any sense. If he used them, and, as also he saith, <hi>Gratian cited them from his Epistle,</hi> how can it be true that they were <hi>Gratians addition only?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="59">59. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Is not <hi>S. W.</hi> a <hi>Romanist?</hi> If he be, then he cannot
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:119753:215"/> but know that the <hi>Corpus juris,</hi> and that part of it which he thus despises, with the title of <hi>Gratians addition only</hi> is in full force with his <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>authority</hi> as constringent, as if it had (which is impossible) been <hi>cited</hi> out of any <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="60">60. <hi>Sixthly</hi> and <hi>lastly</hi> (for here are misadventures enough in a <hi>short</hi> but <hi>pithy</hi> answer) the words shall submit to be <hi>understood in the sense wherein Pope</hi> Pelagius <hi>took them;</hi> But what then is that sense? On the resolving of this, the whole weight of the <hi>answer</hi> necessarily depended, and yet he hath not given the least <hi>intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of that, nor vouchsafed so much as to praetend, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> took them in any sense, but what I and all men understand them in. This indeed is numbring <hi>answers</hi> by the <hi>poll,</hi> and not so much as ever considering, whether the <hi>Reader</hi> be able to advance any higher with all his stock of <hi>rational</hi> faculties, then just to tell <hi>seven,</hi> or <hi>ten.</hi> If he can but do that, and no more, he is a <hi>Reader</hi> after <hi>S. W</hi>'s own heart, and by the <hi>judgement of common sense</hi> he must resolve that the <hi>Romanists</hi> is the <hi>true Religion,</hi> else how could <hi>S. W.</hi> give so many <hi>answers</hi> to one <hi>argument?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="61">61. Passe we then to his eighth <hi>Answer,</hi> it is this, <hi>Aequivalent terms to what they mean by those words were farre more antiently given to the Bishop of Rome Zephyrinus by Tertullian</hi> l. 1. <hi>de pudicitia, where he calls him Pontifex Maximus and Episcopus Episcoporum.]</hi> But what are the <hi>[those words]?</hi> That must be supplyed from the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Testimony</hi> recited in the seventh <hi>answer [Vniversalis est appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landus]</hi> the only <hi>antecedent</hi> to this <hi>relative.</hi> What then the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist</hi> means by <hi>Vniversal Bishop,</hi> is if we will believe <hi>S. W. aequivalent</hi> to <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> and <hi>Episcopus Episcoporum.</hi> What the meaning of those words is, we cannot be ignorant, <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> was the title of the <hi>chief Ruler</hi> of all <hi>sacred</hi> things in <hi>heathen Rome,</hi> and was frequently assumed by the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and proportionable to him, in <hi>Christian Rome,</hi> the <hi>Supreme Governour,</hi> at least in matters of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> cognisance, through the whole world. And so <hi>Episcopus Episcoporum,</hi> the <hi>Bishop of Bishops,</hi> is he to whom all <hi>other Bishops</hi> were <hi>subject.</hi> This then I confesse to be aequivalent to the <hi>title</hi> of <hi>Vniversalis,</hi> and then 'tis strange indeed that both <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> should disclaim being called <hi>Vniversal,</hi> and censure them for <hi>Antichristian</hi> that received it, when yet their Ancestors assumed to be <hi>Bishops of all the Bishops</hi> in the world. It remains
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:119753:215"/> then that we examine the <hi>testimony</hi> on which this is fathered.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. And by the <hi>first</hi> sound of <hi>Tertullian de pudicitia,</hi> we know 'twas a book written in <hi>haeresie,</hi> by a <hi>Montanist,</hi> in <hi>opposition</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> and then, though that would carry little authority with it, to prove that a <hi>truth,</hi> for which it were produced, yet it is hereby rendred the lesse probable, that he that divided from the <hi>Roman Church</hi> at that time, should give the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> the title of <hi>Vniversal Pastor,</hi> or any thing <hi>aequivalent</hi> to it, for that were to professe himself a <hi>Schismatick. Secondly</hi> what is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>de Pudicitia?</hi> Did <hi>Tertullian</hi> write more books with that <hi>title?</hi> other folks have heard but of one; but who can tell, what rarities <hi>S. W</hi>'s greater diligence hath met with in his travails in <hi>Antiquity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="63">63. But passing by these infirmities, 'tis yet sure, that <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> in his <hi>one book de Pudicit.</hi> hath these words, and the Reader, if he please, may view them, soon after the beginning of the Book, where in meer <hi>jeer</hi> and <hi>ironie</hi> he saith, <hi>Audio etiam edictum esse propositum, &amp; quidem peremptorium, Pontifex scilicet Maximus, Episcopus Episcoporum dicit. I hear that an Edict is set out, and that a peremptory one, The High-priest forsooth,</hi> and <hi>the Bishop of Bishops saith,</hi> And some <hi>haereticks</hi> perhaps might smile to see, how glad <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> is of this catch, <hi>Bene habet, &amp; adnotatu dignum, quod etiam jam in haeresi constitutus, &amp; contra Ecclesiam scribens Pontificem Romanum Episcopum Episcoporum nuncupet, &amp; infra c.</hi> 13. <hi>bonum Pastorem &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ctum Papam, &amp;c.</hi> 21. <hi>Apostolicum.</hi> And 'tis very true he doth all this, but no man left to his own eyes could have miss'd to see, in what sense; 'tis all delivered by an enemy, in perfect <hi>scoffe,</hi> as of a <hi>decree</hi> that he saith is <hi>in prostibulis appendendum, to be hanged up in the Stewes,</hi> as <hi>opening the way to sins by proposing impunity to them,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in the same dialect, as <hi>S. W.</hi> would have cryed <hi>Saint,</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> when he meant <hi>haeretical</hi> and talking <hi>nonsense.</hi> And yet this is a <hi>demonstrative</hi> argument on his side, fit to be opposed to two <hi>Popes, Pelagius,</hi> and <hi>Gregories</hi> disclaiming this title, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an <hi>haereticks</hi> jeer hath more convincing force in it with <hi>S. W</hi> than two <hi>fallible Popes</hi> ('tis <hi>archhaeresie,</hi> saith <hi>Mr. White,</hi> to hold them any other) most <hi>seriously</hi> and solemnly <hi>protesting</hi> the <hi>contrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="64">64. But least he may yet mistake this <hi>jeer</hi> for great <hi>earnest,</hi> when the words he gives him are capable of a good sense, I shall
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:119753:216"/> referre him to <hi>St. Cyprian,</hi> that came not long after <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and professes to be a great <hi>Reader</hi> of him, and in much more <hi>earnest</hi> than he, even in a <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Carthage, Neque enim quisquam nostrum Episcopum se esse Episcoporum constituit, aut tyrannico terrore, ad obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendi necessitatem collegas suos adegit, for no one of us hath made himself to be a Bishop of Bishops, or by tyrannical terror hath driven his fellow Bishops to a necessity of obedience.</hi> Which that it was spoken by him particularly in relation to <hi>Stephen, Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time, is resolved by<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ann.</hi> 258. n. 24.</note>
                     <hi>Baronius</hi> himself, and so needs not be more largely proved to a <hi>Romanist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="65">65. But after all this, there is a <hi>ninth and last answer</hi> behinde, which, saith he, <hi>puts this whole businesse out of doubt, Balsamon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, that that title was forbidden, to take away the arrogancy of names, and that for that reason many Patriarchs did style themselves</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>vile and base.</hi> See <hi>Bals. Conc. Carth.</hi> 3. <hi>Can.</hi> 42. <hi>Where though he mingles something of his own Schisme, yet thus farre he is clear for S. W. that the name or title was only treated there, not the thing or Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.]</hi> This is a killing answer indeed, and I shall confesse with <hi>Balsamon,</hi> that these <hi>names were forbid, to take away arrogance,</hi> but can never imagine, that leaving off a <hi>proud</hi> name, and keeping up all the <hi>height,</hi> that is signified by the <hi>name,</hi> could ever be by <hi>wise</hi> or <hi>pious</hi> men look'd on as a supersedeas for, or an <hi>antidote</hi> against <hi>arrogance.</hi> For indeed why should the <hi>name</hi> be <hi>arrogant,</hi> if the <hi>power</hi> that were express'd by it, were not so? and why the <hi>shadow</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously disclaimed and layd down as long as the <hi>solider</hi> part, the <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> were retained? If this be the <hi>answer of answers,</hi> and that which <hi>puts all out of doubt,</hi> which is no other in effect but the yielding as much as I or any other of my <hi>dear friends</hi> (as he saith) demand, the Reader will know hereafter, what is the meaning of <hi>nine answers</hi> to a difficulty, all which, I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consent, shall be judged of by this last <hi>irrefragable</hi> one.</p>
                  <p n="66">66. Only 'tis by the way to be observed, what it is, that in that place <hi>Balsamon mingles of his own Schism,</hi> even nothing in the world but his citing of the 9<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                     <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and the 6<seg rend="sup">th</seg> &amp; 7<seg rend="sup">th</seg> of <hi>Sardice,</hi> but especially directing the Reader to <hi>observe that of Chalcedon,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>which was the later,</hi> not as the <hi>Latine Interpreter reads, quae est antiquior, which is the more ancient.</hi> This is all he saith in that place, beside what <hi>S. W.</hi> hath cited
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:119753:216"/> for his <hi>own interest,</hi> and this it seems was naughtily done of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samon,</hi> who might else, at this turn, have stood intirely upright in <hi>S. W</hi>'s favour, had he not cited <hi>three Canons</hi> of <hi>Councels,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a more <hi>late</hi> one of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> and what is that <hi>later Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Canon?</hi> Why, that a <hi>Clerk must not leave his own Bishop, and flie to secular Judicatures</hi> (which, if he remember, <hi>St Paul</hi> had said, before that <hi>Canon) that if he have any contention with his own Bishop, he shall be judged by the Synod of a Province, that if a Bishop or Clerke have a Controversie with the Metropolitane of the Province, he shall goe to the Exarch of the Diaecese,</hi> i. e. in the ancient style, to the <hi>Primate, or to the throne of the Imperial City of Constantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="67">67. This then was the crime, and <hi>Schisme</hi> of no lesse than an <hi>Ʋniversal Councel,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> himself is sworn not to <hi>violate,</hi> and with that company poor <hi>Balsamon,</hi> and the <hi>Protestants</hi> must be content to fall, in case <hi>S. W.</hi> have by <hi>this answer put this whole businesse out of doubt.</hi> Meanwhile if one of the <hi>four general Councels</hi> be not <hi>Schismatical,</hi> 'tis as good as confess'd that neither are we, and to that issue this whole businesse is come, and there we are content to leave it, whilest <hi>S W.</hi> declaims and <hi>calculates</hi> with his <hi>kinde Reader,</hi> the <hi>manifold weaknesses of this Section.</hi> Which yet he will not conclude, till he hath considered the other part of my <hi>testimonies</hi> of <hi>Phocas</hi>'s <hi>giving Boniface the title of Ʋniversal Bishop.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="68">68. On this he frames a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> that <hi>if I mean the name and title before forbidden, but then first allowed by him, then nothing follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against them who maintain a real power. But if I mean the supreme Jurisdiction over the whole Church, then besides that this Jurisdiction they dispute of was over Kings and Emperors, and so not likely to be given by Phocas the Emperor, they must be put to imagine that an Ʋniversal Government in Ecclesiastical matters over the whole Christian world could be introduced without any visible effects of siding, opposing,</hi> &amp;c. and then he is gotten again into his safe fortresse of <hi>Rushworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> no lesse than <hi>demonstrative Theologie:</hi> To that, being, before this time, become a thredbare repetition, I shall not, I hope, need to attend him, for as I do not take all <hi>Rushworths demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to be such indeed, many of them falling short of <hi>probability,</hi> so 'tis not in the power of a <hi>thousand improbabilities</hi> to praejudice one matter of <hi>fact,</hi> sufficiently testified, it being ordinary to see those things <hi>actually</hi> done, which were most <hi>improbable,</hi> and even
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:119753:217"/> contrary to the <hi>greatest,</hi> and most important <hi>interests</hi> of the doers.</p>
                  <p n="69">69. Only to his <hi>Dilemma</hi> I shall return my short <hi>answer</hi> that all that <hi>Phocas</hi> can be imagined to have afforded <hi>Boniface,</hi> was the <hi>title</hi> of <hi>Vniversal,</hi> which being then gained from him, but no more than a <hi>Sceleton,</hi> being unaccompanied with <hi>power,</hi> hath ever since endeavoured its utmost, to gather <hi>flesh</hi> and juice, <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>verdure</hi> to it, and now takes upon it, as <hi>S. W.</hi> saith, to be a <hi>jurisdiction over</hi> all <hi>Kings and Emperors,</hi> but hath not had the desired successe in attaining it.</p>
                  <p n="70">70. For the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of this <hi>donation</hi> of <hi>Phocas</hi>'s, morer, then that of <hi>Paulus Diaconus,</hi> I have in this <hi>answer</hi> formerly spoken, and therefore this shall suffice to his 16<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                     <hi>Section,</hi> and so we are at length arrived to an end of his <hi>first</hi> part.</p>
